 The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman.
A work by Laurence Sterne
(two lines in Greek)
To the Right Honourable Mr. Pitt.
Sir,
Never poor Wight of a Dedicator had less hopes from his Dedication, than I
have from this of mine; for it is written in a bye corner of the kingdom,
and in a retir'd thatch'd house, where I live in a constant endeavour to
fence against the infirmities of ill health, and other evils of life, by
mirth; being firmly persuaded that every time a man smiles,--but much more
so, when he laughs, it adds something to this Fragment of Life.
I humbly beg, Sir, that you will honour this book, by taking it--(not under
your Protection,--it must protect itself, but)--into the country with you;
where, if I am ever told, it has made you smile; or can conceive it has
beguiled you of one moment's pain--I shall think myself as happy as a
minister of state;--perhaps much happier than any one (one only excepted)
that I have read or heard of.
I am, Great Sir, (and, what is more to your Honour) I am, Good Sir, Your
Well-wisher, and most humble Fellow-subject,
The Author.
The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gent.
Chapter 1.I.
I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were
in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they
begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what they were
then doing;--that not only the production of a rational Being was concerned
in it, but that possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body,
perhaps his genius and the very cast of his mind;--and, for aught they knew
to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might take their turn
from the humours and dispositions which were then uppermost;--Had they duly
weighed and considered all this, and proceeded accordingly,--I am verily
persuaded I should have made a quite different figure in the world, from
that in which the reader is likely to see me.--Believe me, good folks, this
is not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think it;--you have
all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as how they are transfused
from father to son, &c. &c.--and a great deal to that purpose:--Well, you
may take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his nonsense,
his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon their motions and
activity, and the different tracks and trains you put them into, so that
when they are once set a-going, whether right or wrong, 'tis not a half-
penny matter,--away they go cluttering like hey-go mad; and by treading the
same steps over and over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain
and as smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the
Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.
Pray my Dear, quoth my mother, have you not forgot to wind up the clock?--
Good G..! cried my father, making an exclamation, but taking care to
moderate his voice at the same time,--Did ever woman, since the creation of
the world, interrupt a man with such a silly question? Pray, what was your
father saying?--Nothing.
Chapter 1.II.
--Then, positively, there is nothing in the question that I can see, either
good or bad.--Then, let me tell you, Sir, it was a very unseasonable
question at least,--because it scattered and dispersed the animal spirits,
whose business it was to have escorted and gone hand in hand with the
Homunculus, and conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.
The Homunculus, Sir, in however low and ludicrous a light he may appear, in
this age of levity, to the eye of folly or prejudice;--to the eye of reason
in scientific research, he stands confess'd--a Being guarded and
circumscribed with rights.--The minutest philosophers, who by the bye, have
the most enlarged understandings, (their souls being inversely as their
enquiries) shew us incontestably, that the Homunculus is created by the
same hand,--engender'd in the same course of nature,--endow'd with the same
loco-motive powers and faculties with us:--That he consists as we do, of
skin, hair, fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartilages,
bones, marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and articulations;--is a
Being of as much activity,--and in all senses of the word, as much and as
truly our fellow-creature as my Lord Chancellor of England.--He may be
benefitted,--he may be injured,--he may obtain redress; in a word, he has
all the claims and rights of humanity, which Tully, Puffendorf, or the best
ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and relation.
Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way alone!--or
that through terror of it, natural to so young a traveller, my little
Gentleman had got to his journey's end miserably spent;--his muscular
strength and virility worn down to a thread;--his own animal spirits
ruffled beyond description,--and that in this sad disorder'd state of
nerves, he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy
dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months together.--I tremble to
think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand weaknesses both of
body and mind, which no skill of the physician or the philosopher could
ever afterwards have set thoroughly to rights. 
Chapter 1.III.
To my uncle Mr. Toby Shandy do I stand indebted for the preceding anecdote,
to whom my father, who was an excellent natural philosopher, and much given
to close reasoning upon the smallest matters, had oft, and heavily
complained of the injury; but once more particularly, as my uncle Toby well
remember'd, upon his observing a most unaccountable obliquity, (as he
call'd it) in my manner of setting up my top, and justifying the principles
upon which I had done it,--the old gentleman shook his head, and in a tone
more expressive by half of sorrow than reproach,--he said his heart all
along foreboded, and he saw it verified in this, and from a thousand other
observations he had made upon me, That I should neither think nor act like
any other man's child:--But alas! continued he, shaking his head a second
time, and wiping away a tear which was trickling down his cheeks, My
Tristram's misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the
world.
--My mother, who was sitting by, look'd up, but she knew no more than her
backside what my father meant,--but my uncle, Mr. Toby Shandy, who had been
often informed of the affair,--understood him very well.
Chapter 1.IV.
I know there are readers in the world, as well as many other good people in
it, who are no readers at all,--who find themselves ill at ease, unless
they are let into the whole secret from first to last, of every thing which
concerns you.
It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs, and from a
backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living, that I have
been so very particular already. As my life and opinions are likely to
make some noise in the world, and, if I conjecture right, will take in all
ranks, professions, and denominations of men whatever,--be no less read
than the Pilgrim's Progress itself--and in the end, prove the very thing
which Montaigne dreaded his Essays should turn out, that is, a book for a
parlour-window;--I find it necessary to consult every one a little in his
turn; and therefore must beg pardon for going on a little farther in the
same way: For which cause, right glad I am, that I have begun the history
of myself in the way I have done; and that I am able to go on, tracing
every thing in it, as Horace says, ab Ovo.
Horace, I know, does not recommend this fashion altogether: But that
gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a tragedy;--(I forget which,)
besides, if it was not so, I should beg Mr. Horace's pardon;--for in writing
what I have set about, I shall confine myself neither to his rules, nor to
any man's rules that ever lived.
To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these things, I can
give no better advice than that they skip over the remaining part of this
chapter; for I declare before-hand, 'tis wrote only for the curious and
inquisitive.
--Shut the door.--
I was begot in the night betwixt the first Sunday and the first Monday in
the month of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
eighteen. I am positive I was.--But how I came to be so very particular in
my account of a thing which happened before I was born, is owing to another
small anecdote known only in our own family, but now made publick for the
better clearing up this point.
My father, you must know, who was originally a Turkey merchant, but had
left off business for some years, in order to retire to, and die upon, his
paternal estate in the county of ----, was, I believe, one of the most
regular men in every thing he did, whether 'twas matter of business, or
matter of amusement, that ever lived. As a small specimen of this extreme
exactness of his, to which he was in truth a slave, he had made it a rule
for many years of his life,--on the first Sunday-night of every month
throughout the whole year,--as certain as ever the Sunday-night came,--to
wind up a large house-clock, which we had standing on the back-stairs head,
with his own hands:--And being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of
age at the time I have been speaking of,--he had likewise gradually brought
some other little family concernments to the same period, in order, as he
would often say to my uncle Toby, to get them all out of the way at one
time, and be no more plagued and pestered with them the rest of the month.
It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great measure, fell
upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall carry with me to my
grave; namely, that from an unhappy association of ideas, which have no
connection in nature, it so fell out at length, that my poor mother could
never hear the said clock wound up,--but the thoughts of some other things
unavoidably popped into her head--& vice versa:--Which strange combination
of ideas, the sagacious Locke, who certainly understood the nature of these
things better than most men, affirms to have produced more wry actions than
all other sources of prejudice whatsoever.
But this by the bye.
Now it appears by a memorandum in my father's pocket-book, which now lies
upon the table, 'That on Lady-day, which was on the 25th of the same month
in which I date my geniture,--my father set upon his journey to London,
with my eldest brother Bobby, to fix him at Westminster school;' and, as it
appears from the same authority, 'That he did not get down to his wife and
family till the second week in May following,'--it brings the thing almost
to a certainty. However, what follows in the beginning of the next
chapter, puts it beyond all possibility of a doubt.
--But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all December, January, and
February?--Why, Madam,--he was all that time afflicted with a Sciatica. 
Chapter 1.V.
On the fifth day of November, 1718, which to the aera fixed on, was as near
nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have expected,--was I
Tristram Shandy, Gentleman, brought forth into this scurvy and disastrous
world of ours.--I wish I had been born in the Moon, or in any of the
planets, (except Jupiter or Saturn, because I never could bear cold
weather) for it could not well have fared worse with me in any of them
(though I will not answer for Venus) than it has in this vile, dirty planet
of ours,--which, o' my conscience, with reverence be it spoken, I take to
be made up of the shreds and clippings of the rest;--not but the planet is
well enough, provided a man could be born in it to a great title or to a
great estate; or could any how contrive to be called up to public charges,
and employments of dignity or power;--but that is not my case;--and
therefore every man will speak of the fair as his own market has gone in
it;--for which cause I affirm it over again to be one of the vilest worlds
that ever was made;--for I can truly say, that from the first hour I drew
my breath in it, to this, that I can now scarce draw it at all, for an
asthma I got in scating against the wind in Flanders;--I have been the
continual sport of what the world calls Fortune; and though I will not
wrong her by saying, She has ever made me feel the weight of any great or
signal evil;--yet with all the good temper in the world I affirm it of her,
that in every stage of my life, and at every turn and corner where she
could get fairly at me, the ungracious duchess has pelted me with a set of
as pitiful misadventures and cross accidents as ever small Hero sustained.
Chapter 1.VI.
In the beginning of the last chapter, I informed you exactly when I was
born; but I did not inform you how. No, that particular was reserved
entirely for a chapter by itself;--besides, Sir, as you and I are in a
manner perfect strangers to each other, it would not have been proper to
have let you into too many circumstances relating to myself all at once.
--You must have a little patience. I have undertaken, you see, to write
not only my life, but my opinions also; hoping and expecting that your
knowledge of my character, and of what kind of a mortal I am, by the one,
would give you a better relish for the other: As you proceed farther with
me, the slight acquaintance, which is now beginning betwixt us, will grow
into familiarity; and that unless one of us is in fault, will terminate in
friendship.--O diem praeclarum!--then nothing which has touched me will be
thought trifling in its nature, or tedious in its telling. Therefore, my
dear friend and companion, if you should think me somewhat sparing of my
narrative on my first setting out--bear with me,--and let me go on, and
tell my story my own way:--Or, if I should seem now and then to trifle upon
the road,--or should sometimes put on a fool's cap with a bell to it, for a
moment or two as we pass along,--don't fly off,--but rather courteously
give me credit for a little more wisdom than appears upon my outside;--and
as we jog on, either laugh with me, or at me, or in short do any thing,--
only keep your temper.
Chapter 1.VII.
In the same village where my father and my mother dwelt, dwelt also a thin,
upright, motherly, notable, good old body of a midwife, who with the help
of a little plain good sense, and some years full employment in her
business, in which she had all along trusted little to her own efforts, and
a great deal to those of dame Nature,--had acquired, in her way, no small
degree of reputation in the world:--by which word world, need I in this
place inform your worship, that I would be understood to mean no more of
it, than a small circle described upon the circle of the great world, of
four English miles diameter, or thereabouts, of which the cottage where the
good old woman lived is supposed to be the centre?--She had been left it
seems a widow in great distress, with three or four small children, in her
forty-seventh year; and as she was at that time a person of decent
carriage,--grave deportment,--a woman moreover of few words and withal an
object of compassion, whose distress, and silence under it, called out the
louder for a friendly lift: the wife of the parson of the parish was
touched with pity; and having often lamented an inconvenience to which her
husband's flock had for many years been exposed, inasmuch as there was no
such thing as a midwife, of any kind or degree, to be got at, let the case
have been never so urgent, within less than six or seven long miles riding;
which said seven long miles in dark nights and dismal roads, the country
thereabouts being nothing but a deep clay, was almost equal to fourteen;
and that in effect was sometimes next to having no midwife at all; it came
into her head, that it would be doing as seasonable a kindness to the whole
parish, as to the poor creature herself, to get her a little instructed in
some of the plain principles of the business, in order to set her up in it. 
As no woman thereabouts was better qualified to execute the plan she had
formed than herself, the gentlewoman very charitably undertook it; and
having great influence over the female part of the parish, she found no
difficulty in effecting it to the utmost of her wishes. In truth, the
parson join'd his interest with his wife's in the whole affair, and in
order to do things as they should be, and give the poor soul as good a
title by law to practise, as his wife had given by institution,--he
cheerfully paid the fees for the ordinary's licence himself, amounting in
the whole, to the sum of eighteen shillings and four pence; so that betwixt
them both, the good woman was fully invested in the real and corporal
possession of her office, together with all its rights, members, and
appurtenances whatsoever.
These last words, you must know, were not according to the old form in
which such licences, faculties, and powers usually ran, which in like cases
had heretofore been granted to the sisterhood. But it was according to a
neat Formula of Didius his own devising, who having a particular turn for
taking to pieces, and new framing over again all kind of instruments in
that way, not only hit upon this dainty amendment, but coaxed many of the
old licensed matrons in the neighbourhood, to open their faculties afresh,
in order to have this wham-wham of his inserted. 
I own I never could envy Didius in these kinds of fancies of his:--But
every man to his own taste.--Did not Dr. Kunastrokius, that great man, at
his leisure hours, take the greatest delight imaginable in combing of asses
tails, and plucking the dead hairs out with his teeth, though he had
tweezers always in his pocket? Nay, if you come to that, Sir, have not the
wisest of men in all ages, not excepting Solomon himself,--have they not
had their Hobby-Horses;--their running horses,--their coins and their
cockle-shells, their drums and their trumpets, their fiddles, their
pallets,--their maggots and their butterflies?--and so long as a man rides
his Hobby-Horse peaceably and quietly along the King's highway, and neither
compels you or me to get up behind him,--pray, Sir, what have either you or
I to do with it?
Chapter 1.VIII.
--De gustibus non est disputandum;--that is, there is no disputing against
Hobby-Horses; and for my part, I seldom do; nor could I with any sort of
grace, had I been an enemy to them at the bottom; for happening, at certain
intervals and changes of the moon, to be both fidler and painter, according
as the fly stings:--Be it known to you, that I keep a couple of pads
myself, upon which, in their turns, (nor do I care who knows it) I
frequently ride out and take the air;--though sometimes, to my shame be it
spoken, I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think
altogether right.--But the truth is,--I am not a wise man;--and besides am
a mortal of so little consequence in the world, it is not much matter what
I do: so I seldom fret or fume at all about it: Nor does it much disturb
my rest, when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as hereafter
follow;--such, for instance, as my Lord A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M,
N, O, P, Q, and so on, all of a row, mounted upon their several horses,--
some with large stirrups, getting on in a more grave and sober pace;--
others on the contrary, tucked up to their very chins, with whips across
their mouths, scouring and scampering it away like so many little party-
coloured devils astride a mortgage,--and as if some of them were resolved
to break their necks.--So much the better--say I to myself;--for in case
the worst should happen, the world will make a shift to do excellently well
without them; and for the rest,--why--God speed them--e'en let them ride on
without opposition from me; for were their lordships unhorsed this very
night--'tis ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one
half before tomorrow morning.
Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my rest.-
-But there is an instance, which I own puts me off my guard, and that is,
when I see one born for great actions, and what is still more for his
honour, whose nature ever inclines him to good ones;--when I behold such a
one, my Lord, like yourself, whose principles and conduct are as generous
and noble as his blood, and whom, for that reason, a corrupt world cannot
spare one moment;--when I see such a one, my Lord, mounted, though it is
but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed
to him, and my zeal for his glory wishes,--then, my Lord, I cease to be a
philosopher, and in the first transport of an honest impatience, I wish the
Hobby-Horse, with all his fraternity, at the Devil.
'My Lord,
I maintain this to be a dedication, notwithstanding its singularity in the
three great essentials of matter, form and place: I beg, therefore, you
will accept it as such, and that you will permit me to lay it, with the
most respectful humility, at your Lordship's feet--when you are upon them,-
-which you can be when you please;--and that is, my Lord, whenever there is
occasion for it, and I will add, to the best purposes too. I have the
honour to be, 
My Lord, 
Your Lordship's most obedient,
and most devoted,
and most humble servant,
Tristram Shandy.'
Chapter 1.IX.
I solemnly declare to all mankind, that the above dedication was made for
no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or Potentate,--Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount,
or Baron, of this, or any other Realm in Christendom;--nor has it yet been
hawked about, or offered publicly or privately, directly or indirectly, to
any one person or personage, great or small; but is honestly a true Virgin-
Dedication untried on, upon any soul living. 
I labour this point so particularly, merely to remove any offence or
objection which might arise against it from the manner in which I propose
to make the most of it;--which is the putting it up fairly to public sale;
which I now do.
--Every author has a way of his own in bringing his points to bear;--for my
own part, as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark
entry;--I resolved within myself, from the very beginning, to deal squarely
and openly with your Great Folks in this affair, and try whether I should
not come off the better by it.
If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, in
these his Majesty's dominions, who stands in need of a tight, genteel
dedication, and whom the above will suit, (for by the bye, unless it suits
in some degree, I will not part with it)--it is much at his service for
fifty guineas;--which I am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to
be afforded for, by any man of genius.
My Lord, if you examine it over again, it is far from being a gross piece
of daubing, as some dedications are. The design, your Lordship sees, is
good,--the colouring transparent,--the drawing not amiss;--or to speak more
like a man of science,--and measure my piece in the painter's scale,
divided into 20,--I believe, my Lord, the outlines will turn out as 12,--
the composition as 9,--the colouring as 6,--the expression 13 and a half,--
and the design,--if I may be allowed, my Lord, to understand my own design,
and supposing absolute perfection in designing, to be as 20,--I think it
cannot well fall short of 19. Besides all this,--there is keeping in it,
and the dark strokes in the Hobby-Horse, (which is a secondary figure, and
a kind of back-ground to the whole) give great force to the principal
lights in your own figure, and make it come off wonderfully;--and besides,
there is an air of originality in the tout ensemble.
Be pleased, my good Lord, to order the sum to be paid into the hands of Mr.
Dodsley, for the benefit of the author; and in the next edition care shall
be taken that this chapter be expunged, and your Lordship's titles,
distinctions, arms, and good actions, be placed at the front of the
preceding chapter: All which, from the words, De gustibus non est
disputandum, and whatever else in this book relates to Hobby-Horses, but no
more, shall stand dedicated to your Lordship.--The rest I dedicate to the
Moon, who, by the bye, of all the Patrons or Matrons I can think of, has
most power to set my book a-going, and make the world run mad after it.
Bright Goddess,
If thou art not too busy with Candid and Miss Cunegund's affairs,--take
Tristram Shandy's under thy protection also.
Chapter 1.X.
Whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the
midwife might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly rested,--at first
sight seems not very material to this history;--certain however it was,
that the gentlewoman, the parson's wife, did run away at that time with the
whole of it: And yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking but that the
parson himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design
first,--yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before
him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution, had
a claim to some share of it,--if not to a full half of whatever honour was
due to it.
The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise.
Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a probable guess
at the grounds of this procedure.
Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of the
midwife's licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an account,--the
parson we have to do with had made himself a country-talk by a breach of
all decorum, which he had committed against himself, his station, and his
office;--and that was in never appearing better, or otherwise mounted, than
upon a lean, sorry, jackass of a horse, value about one pound fifteen
shillings; who, to shorten all description of him, was full brother to
Rosinante, as far as similitude congenial could make him; for he answered
his description to a hair-breadth in every thing,--except that I do not
remember 'tis any where said, that Rosinante was broken-winded; and that,
moreover, Rosinante, as is the happiness of most Spanish horses, fat or
lean,--was undoubtedly a horse at all points.
I know very well that the Hero's horse was a horse of chaste deportment,
which may have given grounds for the contrary opinion: But it is as
certain at the same time that Rosinante's continency (as may be
demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesian carriers) proceeded from
no bodily defect or cause whatsoever, but from the temperance and orderly
current of his blood.--And let me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of
very good chastity in the world, in behalf of which you could not say more
for your life.
Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do exact justice to every
creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work,--I could not stifle
this distinction in favour of Don Quixote's horse;--in all other points,
the parson's horse, I say, was just such another, for he was as lean, and
as lank, and as sorry a jade, as Humility herself could have bestrided.
In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it was greatly
in the parson's power to have helped the figure of this horse of his,--for
he was master of a very handsome demi-peaked saddle, quilted on the seat
with green plush, garnished with a double row of silver-headed studs, and a
noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a housing altogether suitable,
of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of black lace, terminating in a
deep, black, silk fringe, poudre d'or,--all which he had purchased in the
pride and prime of his life, together with a grand embossed bridle,
ornamented at all points as it should be.--But not caring to banter his
beast, he had hung all these up behind his study door: and, in lieu of
them, had seriously befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle,
as the figure and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve.
In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring visits to
the gentry who lived around him,--you will easily comprehend, that the
parson, so appointed, would both hear and see enough to keep his philosophy
from rusting. To speak the truth, he never could enter a village, but he
caught the attention of both old and young.--Labour stood still as he
pass'd--the bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well,--the spinning-
wheel forgot its round,--even chuck-farthing and shuffle-cap themselves
stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as his movement was not of
the quickest, he had generally time enough upon his hands to make his
observations,--to hear the groans of the serious,--and the laughter of the
light-hearted; all which he bore with excellent tranquillity.--His
character was,--he loved a jest in his heart--and as he saw himself in the
true point of ridicule, he would say he could not be angry with others for
seeing him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself: So that to his
friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money, and who therefore
made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his humour,--instead
of giving the true cause,--he chose rather to join in the laugh against
himself; and as he never carried one single ounce of flesh upon his own
bones, being altogether as spare a figure as his beast,--he would sometimes
insist upon it, that the horse was as good as the rider deserved;--that
they were, centaur-like,--both of a piece. At other times, and in other
moods, when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit,--he would
say, he found himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great
gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse, without
a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse; and that he
had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to keep himself in
countenance, but in spirits.
At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons for
riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse, preferably to one of
mettle;--for on such a one he could sit mechanically, and meditate as
delightfully de vanitate mundi et fuga faeculi, as with the advantage of a
death's-head before him;--that, in all other exercitations, he could spend
his time, as he rode slowly along,--to as much account as in his study;--
that he could draw up an argument in his sermon,--or a hole in his
breeches, as steadily on the one as in the other;--that brisk trotting and
slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two incompatible
movements.--But that upon his steed--he could unite and reconcile every
thing,--he could compose his sermon--he could compose his cough,--and, in
case nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to
sleep.--In short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any cause
but the true cause,--and he with-held the true one, only out of a nicety of
temper, because he thought it did honour to him.
But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of this
gentleman's life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle were
purchased by him, it had been his manner, or vanity, or call it what you
will,--to run into the opposite extreme.--In the language of the county
where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good horse, and generally had
one of the best in the whole parish standing in his stable always ready for
saddling: and as the nearest midwife, as I told you, did not live nearer to
the village than seven miles, and in a vile country,--it so fell out that
the poor gentleman was scarce a whole week together without some piteous
application for his beast; and as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and
every case was more pressing and more distressful than the last;--as much
as he loved his beast, he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of
which was generally this; that his horse was either clapp'd, or spavin'd,
or greaz'd;--or he was twitter-bon'd, or broken-winded, or something, in
short, or other had befallen him, which would let him carry no flesh;--so
that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of,--and a good
horse to purchase in his stead.
What the loss in such a balance might amount to, communibus annis, I would
leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffick, to determine;--
but let it be what it would, the honest gentleman bore it for many years
without a murmur, till at length, by repeated ill accidents of the kind, he
found it necessary to take the thing under consideration; and upon weighing
the whole, and summing it up in his mind, he found it not only
disproportioned to his other expences, but withal so heavy an article in
itself, as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish: 
Besides this, he considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he
could do ten times as much good;--and what still weighed more with him than
all other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his
charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was the
least wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his
parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,--nothing for the aged,--nothing
for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit, where
poverty, and sickness and affliction dwelt together. 
For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there
appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it;--and
these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his
steed upon any application whatever,--or else be content to ride the last
poor devil, such as they had made him, with all his aches and infirmities,
to the very end of the chapter.
As he dreaded his own constancy in the first--he very chearfully betook
himself to the second; and though he could very well have explained it, as
I said, to his honour,--yet, for that very reason, he had a spirit above
it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies, and the laughter
of his friends, than undergo the pain of telling a story, which might seem
a panegyrick upon himself.
I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this
reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which I think
comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of La
Mancha, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I love more, and would
actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than the greatest hero
of antiquity.
But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view was to shew
the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.--For you must know,
that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit,--the
devil a soul could find it out,--I suppose his enemies would not, and that
his friends could not.--But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of
the midwife, and pay the expences of the ordinary's licence to set her up,-
-but the whole secret came out; every horse he had lost, and two horses
more than ever he had lost, with all the circumstances of their
destruction, were known and distinctly remembered.--The story ran like
wild-fire.--'The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized
him; and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if it
was so, 'twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he would pocket the expence of
the licence ten times told, the very first year:--So that every body was
left to judge what were his views in this act of charity.'
What were his views in this, and in every other action of his life,--or
rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people
concerning it, was a thought which too much floated in his own, and too
often broke in upon his rest, when he should have been sound asleep.
About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely
easy upon that score,--it being just so long since he left his parish,--and
the whole world at the same time behind him,--and stands accountable to a
Judge of whom he will have no cause to complain.
But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order them as
they will, they pass thro' a certain medium, which so twists and refracts
them from their true directions--that, with all the titles to praise which
a rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them are nevertheless forced to
live and die without it.
Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful example.--But to know
by what means this came to pass,--and to make that knowledge of use to you,
I insist upon it that you read the two following chapters, which contain
such a sketch of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along
with it.--When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way, we will go on
with the midwife.
Chapter 1.XI.
Yorick was this parson's name, and, what is very remarkable in it, (as
appears from a most ancient account of the family, wrote upon strong
vellum, and now in perfect preservation) it had been exactly so spelt for
near,--I was within an ace of saying nine hundred years;--but I would not
shake my credit in telling an improbable truth, however indisputable in
itself,--and therefore I shall content myself with only saying--It had been
exactly so spelt, without the least variation or transposition of a single
letter, for I do not know how long; which is more than I would venture to
say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom; which, in a course of
years, have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their owners.-
-Has this been owing to the pride, or to the shame of the respective
proprietors?--In honest truth, I think sometimes to the one, and sometimes
to the other, just as the temptation has wrought. But a villainous affair
it is, and will one day so blend and confound us all together, that no one
shall be able to stand up and swear, 'That his own great grandfather was
the man who did either this or that.'
This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the
Yorick's family, and their religious preservation of these records I quote,
which do farther inform us, That the family was originally of Danish
extraction, and had been transplanted into England as early as in the reign
of Horwendillus, king of Denmark, in whose court, it seems, an ancestor of
this Mr. Yorick's, and from whom he was lineally descended, held a
considerable post to the day of his death. Of what nature this
considerable post was, this record saith not;--it only adds, That, for near
two centuries, it had been totally abolished, as altogether unnecessary,
not only in that court, but in every other court of the Christian world.
It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than that
of the king's chief Jester;--and that Hamlet's Yorick, in our Shakespeare,
many of whose plays, you know, are founded upon authenticated facts, was
certainly the very man.
I have not the time to look into Saxo-Grammaticus's Danish history, to know
the certainty of this;--but if you have leisure, and can easily get at the
book, you may do it full as well yourself.
I had just time, in my travels through Denmark with Mr. Noddy's eldest son,
whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied as governor, riding along with him at
a prodigious rate thro' most parts of Europe, and of which original journey
performed by us two, a most delectable narrative will be given in the
progress of this work. I had just time, I say, and that was all, to prove
the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country;--
namely, 'That nature was neither very lavish, nor was she very stingy in
her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants;--but, like a discreet
parent, was moderately kind to them all; observing such an equal tenor in
the distribution of her favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty
near to a level with each other; so that you will meet with few instances
in that kingdom of refined parts; but a great deal of good plain houshold
understanding amongst all ranks of people, of which every body has a
share;' which is, I think, very right.
With us, you see, the case is quite different:--we are all ups and downs in
this matter;--you are a great genius;--or 'tis fifty to one, Sir, you are a
great dunce and a blockhead;--not that there is a total want of
intermediate steps,--no,--we are not so irregular as that comes to;--but
the two extremes are more common, and in a greater degree in this unsettled
island, where nature, in her gifts and dispositions of this kind, is most
whimsical and capricious; fortune herself not being more so in the bequest
of her goods and chattels than she.
This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to Yorick's extraction,
who, by what I can remember of him, and by all the accounts I could ever
get of him, seemed not to have had one single drop of Danish blood in his
whole crasis; in nine hundred years, it might possibly have all run out:--I
will not philosophize one moment with you about it; for happen how it
would, the fact was this:--That instead of that cold phlegm and exact
regularity of sense and humours, you would have looked for, in one so
extracted;--he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and sublimated a
composition,--as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions;--with as
much life and whim, and gaite de coeur about him, as the kindliest climate
could have engendered and put together. With all this sail, poor Yorick
carried not one ounce of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world;
and at the age of twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his
course in it, as a romping, unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that upon
his first setting out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine,
ran him foul ten times in a day of somebody's tackling; and as the grave
and more slow-paced were oftenest in his way,--you may likewise imagine,
'twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled. 
For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom
of such Fracas:--For, to speak the truth, Yorick had an invincible dislike
and opposition in his nature to gravity;--not to gravity as such;--for
where gravity was wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal
men for days and weeks together;--but he was an enemy to the affectation of
it, and declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for
ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it fell in his way, however
sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much quarter.
Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say, that Gravity was an
errant scoundrel, and he would add,--of the most dangerous kind too,--
because a sly one; and that he verily believed, more honest, well-meaning
people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve-month,
than by pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In the naked temper
which a merry heart discovered, he would say there was no danger,--but to
itself:--whereas the very essence of gravity was design, and consequently
deceit;--'twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense
and knowledge than a man was worth; and that, with all its pretensions,--it
was no better, but often worse, than what a French wit had long ago defined
it,--viz. 'A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the
mind;'--which definition of gravity, Yorick, with great imprudence, would
say, deserved to be wrote in letters of gold.
But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world,
and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of
discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint. Yorick had no
impression but one, and that was what arose from the nature of the deed
spoken of; which impression he would usually translate into plain English
without any periphrasis;--and too oft without much distinction of either
person, time, or place;--so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an
ungenerous proceeding--he never gave himself a moment's time to reflect who
was the hero of the piece,--what his station,--or how far he had power to
hurt him hereafter;--but if it was a dirty action,--without more ado,--The
man was a dirty fellow,--and so on.--And as his comments had usually the
ill fate to be terminated either in a bon mot, or to be enlivened
throughout with some drollery or humour of expression, it gave wings to
Yorick's indiscretion. In a word, tho' he never sought, yet, at the same
time, as he seldom shunned occasions of saying what came uppermost, and
without much ceremony;--he had but too many temptations in life, of
scattering his wit and his humour,--his gibes and his jests about him.--
They were not lost for want of gathering.
What were the consequences, and what was Yorick's catastrophe thereupon,
you will read in the next chapter.
Chapter 1.XII.
The Mortgager and Mortgagee differ the one from the other, not more in
length of purse, than the Jester and Jestee do, in that of memory. But in
this the comparison between them runs, as the scholiasts call it, upon all-
four; which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more than some of the best
of Homer's can pretend to;--namely, That the one raises a sum, and the
other a laugh at your expence, and thinks no more about it. Interest,
however, still runs on in both cases;--the periodical or accidental
payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive; till,
at length, in some evil hour, pop comes the creditor upon each, and by
demanding principal upon the spot, together with full interest to the very
day, makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations.
As the reader (for I hate your ifs) has a thorough knowledge of human
nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my Hero could not go on at
this rate without some slight experience of these incidental mementos. To
speak the truth, he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small
book-debts of this stamp, which, notwithstanding Eugenius's frequent
advice, he too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was
contracted thro' any malignancy;--but, on the contrary, from an honesty of
mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cross'd out
in course.
Eugenius would never admit this; and would often tell him, that one day or
other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would often add, in an
accent of sorrowful apprehension,--to the uttermost mite. To which Yorick,
with his usual carelessness of heart, would as often answer with a pshaw!--
and if the subject was started in the fields,--with a hop, skip, and a jump
at the end of it; but if close pent up in the social chimney-corner, where
the culprit was barricado'd in, with a table and a couple of arm-chairs,
and could not so readily fly off in a tangent,--Eugenius would then go on
with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose, though somewhat
better put together.
Trust me, dear Yorick, this unwary pleasantry of thine will sooner or later
bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no after-wit can extricate
thee out of.--In these sallies, too oft, I see, it happens, that a person
laughed at, considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all
the rights of such a situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest him
in that light too, and reckons up his friends, his family, his kindred and
allies,--and musters up with them the many recruits which will list under
him from a sense of common danger;--'tis no extravagant arithmetic to say,
that for every ten jokes,--thou hast got an hundred enemies; and till thou
hast gone on, and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half
stung to death by them, thou wilt never be convinced it is so.
I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the least spur
from spleen or malevolence of intent in these sallies--I believe and know
them to be truly honest and sportive:--But consider, my dear lad, that
fools cannot distinguish this,--and that knaves will not: and thou knowest
not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with the
other:--whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend upon it, they
will carry on the war in such a manner against thee, my dear friend, as to
make thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life too.
Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at thee,
which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set right.--The
fortunes of thy house shall totter,--thy character, which led the way to
them, shall bleed on every side of it,--thy faith questioned,--thy works
belied,--thy wit forgotten,--thy learning trampled on. To wind up the last
scene of thy tragedy, Cruelty and Cowardice, twin ruffians, hired and set
on by Malice in the dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities and
mistakes:--The best of us, my dear lad, lie open there,--and trust me,--
trust me, Yorick, when to gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved
upon, that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, 'tis
an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has
strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with.
Yorick scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny read over to
him, but with a tear stealing from his eye, and a promissory look attending
it, that he was resolved, for the time to come, to ride his tit with more
sobriety.--But, alas, too late!--a grand confederacy with. . .and. . .at
the head of it, was formed before the first prediction of it.--The whole
plan of the attack, just as Eugenius had foreboded, was put in execution
all at once,--with so little mercy on the side of the allies,--and so
little suspicion in Yorick, of what was carrying on against him,--that when
he thought, good easy man! full surely preferment was o'ripening,--they had
smote his root, and then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before
him.
Yorick, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry for some time;
till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by the calamities of
the war,--but more so, by the ungenerous manner in which it was carried
on,--he threw down the sword; and though he kept up his spirits in
appearance to the last, he died, nevertheless, as was generally thought,
quite broken-hearted.
What inclined Eugenius to the same opinion was as follows:
A few hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius stept in with an
intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him. Upon his drawing
Yorick's curtain, and asking how he felt himself, Yorick looking up in his
face took hold of his hand,--and after thanking him for the many tokens of
his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet
hereafter,--he would thank him again and again,--he told him, he was within
a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever.--I hope not, answered
Eugenius, with tears trickling down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone
that ever man spoke.--I hope not, Yorick, said he.--Yorick replied, with a
look up, and a gentle squeeze of Eugenius's hand, and that was all,--but it
cut Eugenius to his heart.--Come,--come, Yorick, quoth Eugenius, wiping his
eyes, and summoning up the man within him,--my dear lad, be comforted,--let
not all thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou
most wants them;--who knows what resources are in store, and what the power
of God may yet do for thee!--Yorick laid his hand upon his heart, and
gently shook his head;--For my part, continued Eugenius, crying bitterly as
he uttered the words,--I declare I know not, Yorick, how to part with thee,
and would gladly flatter my hopes, added Eugenius, chearing up his voice,
that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop, and that I may
live to see it.--I beseech thee, Eugenius, quoth Yorick, taking off his
night-cap as well as he could with his left hand,--his right being still
grasped close in that of Eugenius,--I beseech thee to take a view of my
head.--I see nothing that ails it, replied Eugenius. Then, alas! my
friend, said Yorick, let me tell you, that 'tis so bruised and mis-shapened
with the blows which. . .and. . ., and some others have so unhandsomely
given me in the dark, that I might say with Sancho Panca, that should I
recover, and 'Mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as
thick as hail, not one of them would fit it.'--Yorick's last breath was
hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this:--yet
still it was uttered with something of a Cervantick tone;--and as he spoke
it, Eugenius could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a
moment in his eyes;--faint picture of those flashes of his spirit, which
(as Shakespeare said of his ancestor) were wont to set the table in a roar!
Eugenius was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend was broke: 
he squeezed his hand,--and then walked softly out of the room, weeping as
he walked. Yorick followed Eugenius with his eyes to the door,--he then
closed them, and never opened them more.
He lies buried in the corner of his church-yard, in the parish of. . .,
under a plain marble slab, which his friend Eugenius, by leave of his
executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than these three words of
inscription, serving both for his epitaph and elegy. Alas, poor Yorick!
Ten times a day has Yorick's ghost the consolation to hear his monumental
inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones, as denote a
general pity and esteem for him;--a foot-way crossing the church-yard close
by the side of his grave,--not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast
a look upon it,--and sighing as he walks on, Alas, poor Yorick!
Chapter 1.XIII.
It is so long since the reader of this rhapsodical work has been parted
from the midwife, that it is high time to mention her again to him, merely
to put him in mind that there is such a body still in the world, and whom,
upon the best judgment I can form upon my own plan at present, I am going
to introduce to him for good and all: But as fresh matter may be started,
and much unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself, which
may require immediate dispatch;--'twas right to take care that the poor
woman should not be lost in the mean time;--because when she is wanted, we
can no way do without her.
I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note and
consequence throughout our whole village and township;--that her fame had
spread itself to the very out-edge and circumference of that circle of
importance, of which kind every soul living, whether he has a shirt to his
back or no,--has one surrounding him;--which said circle, by the way,
whenever 'tis said that such a one is of great weight and importance in the
world,--I desire may be enlarged or contracted in your worship's fancy, in
a compound ratio of the station, profession, knowledge, abilities, height
and depth (measuring both ways) of the personage brought before you.
In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or five miles,
which not only comprehended the whole parish, but extended itself to two or
three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next parish; which made
a considerable thing of it. I must add, That she was, moreover, very well
looked on at one large grange-house, and some other odd houses and farms
within two or three miles, as I said, from the smoke of her own chimney:--
But I must here, once for all, inform you, that all this will be more
exactly delineated and explain'd in a map, now in the hands of the
engraver, which, with many other pieces and developements of this work,
will be added to the end of the twentieth volume,--not to swell the work,--
I detest the thought of such a thing;--but by way of commentary, scholium,
illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or inuendos as shall be
thought to be either of private interpretation, or of dark or doubtful
meaning, after my life and my opinions shall have been read over (now don't 
forget the meaning of the word) by all the world;--which, betwixt you and
me, and in spite of all the gentlemen-reviewers in Great Britain, and of
all that their worships shall undertake to write or say to the contrary,--I
am determined shall be the case.--I need not tell your worship, that all
this is spoke in confidence.
Chapter 1.XIV.
Upon looking into my mother's marriage settlement, in order to satisfy
myself and reader in a point necessary to be cleared up, before we could
proceed any farther in this history;--I had the good fortune to pop upon
the very thing I wanted before I had read a day and a half straight
forwards,--it might have taken me up a month;--which shews plainly, that
when a man sits down to write a history,--tho' it be but the history of
Jack Hickathrift or Tom Thumb, he knows no more than his heels what lets
and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his way,--or what a dance
he may be led, by one excursion or another, before all is over. Could a
historiographer drive on his history, as a muleteer drives on his mule,--
straight forward;--for instance, from Rome all the way to Loretto, without
ever once turning his head aside, either to the right hand or to the left,-
-he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he should get to his
journey's end;--but the thing is, morally speaking, impossible: For, if he
is a man of the least spirit, he will have fifty deviations from a straight
line to make with this or that party as he goes along, which he can no ways
avoid. He will have views and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting
his eye, which he can no more help standing still to look at than he can
fly; he will moreover have various 
Accounts to reconcile: 
Anecdotes to pick up: 
Inscriptions to make out: 
Stories to weave in: 
Traditions to sift: 
Personages to call upon: 
Panegyricks to paste up at this door; 
Pasquinades at that:--All which both the man and his mule are quite exempt
from. To sum up all; there are archives at every stage to be look'd into,
and rolls, records, documents, and endless genealogies, which justice ever
and anon calls him back to stay the reading of:--In short there is no end
of it;--for my own part, I declare I have been at it these six weeks,
making all the speed I possibly could,--and am not yet born:--I have just
been able, and that's all, to tell you when it happen'd, but not how;--so
that you see the thing is yet far from being accomplished.
These unforeseen stoppages, which I own I had no conception of when I first
set out;--but which, I am convinced now, will rather increase than diminish
as I advance,--have struck out a hint which I am resolved to follow;--and
that is,--not to be in a hurry;--but to go on leisurely, writing and
publishing two volumes of my life every year;--which, if I am suffered to
go on quietly, and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller, I shall
continue to do as long as I live.
Chapter 1.XV.
The article in my mother's marriage-settlement, which I told the reader I
was at the pains to search for, and which, now that I have found it, I
think proper to lay before him,--is so much more fully express'd in the
deed itself, than ever I can pretend to do it, that it would be barbarity
to take it out of the lawyer's hand:--It is as follows.
'And this Indenture further witnesseth, That the said Walter Shandy,
merchant, in consideration of the said intended marriage to be had, and, by
God's blessing, to be well and truly solemnized and consummated between the
said Walter Shandy and Elizabeth Mollineux aforesaid, and divers other good
and valuable causes and considerations him thereunto specially moving,--
doth grant, covenant, condescend, consent, conclude, bargain, and fully
agree to and with John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. the above-named
Trustees, &c. &c.--to wit,--That in case it should hereafter so fall out,
chance, happen, or otherwise come to pass,--That the said Walter Shandy,
merchant, shall have left off business before the time or times, that the
said Elizabeth Mollineux shall, according to the course of nature, or
otherwise, have left off bearing and bringing forth children;--and that, in
consequence of the said Walter Shandy having so left off business, he shall
in despight, and against the free-will, consent, and good-liking of the
said Elizabeth Mollineux,--make a departure from the city of London, in
order to retire to, and dwell upon, his estate at Shandy Hall, in the
county of. . ., or at any other country-seat, castle, hall, mansion-house,
messuage or grainge-house, now purchased, or hereafter to be purchased, or
upon any part or parcel thereof:--That then, and as often as the said
Elizabeth Mollineux shall happen to be enceint with child or children
severally and lawfully begot, or to be begotten, upon the body of the said
Elizabeth Mollineux, during her said coverture,--he the said Walter Shandy
shall, at his own proper cost and charges, and out of his own proper
monies, upon good and reasonable notice, which is hereby agreed to be
within six weeks of her the said Elizabeth Mollineux's full reckoning, or
time of supposed and computed delivery,--pay, or cause to be paid, the sum
of one hundred and twenty pounds of good and lawful money, to John Dixon,
and James Turner, Esqrs. or assigns,--upon Trust and confidence, and for
and unto the use and uses, intent, end, and purpose following:--That is to
say,--That the said sum of one hundred and twenty pounds shall be paid into
the hands of the said Elizabeth Mollineux, or to be otherwise applied by
them the said Trustees, for the well and truly hiring of one coach, with
able and sufficient horses, to carry and convey the body of the said
Elizabeth Mollineux, and the child or children which she shall be then and
there enceint and pregnant with,--unto the city of London; and for the
further paying and defraying of all other incidental costs, charges, and
expences whatsoever,--in and about, and for, and relating to, her said
intended delivery and lying-in, in the said city or suburbs thereof. And
that the said Elizabeth Mollineux shall and may, from time to time, and at
all such time and times as are here covenanted and agreed upon,--peaceably
and quietly hire the said coach and horses, and have free ingress, egress,
and regress throughout her journey, in and from the said coach, according
to the tenor, true intent, and meaning of these presents, without any let,
suit, trouble, disturbance, molestation, discharge, hinderance, forfeiture,
eviction, vexation, interruption, or incumbrance whatsoever.--And that it
shall moreover be lawful to and for the said Elizabeth Mollineux, from time
to time, and as oft or often as she shall well and truly be advanced in her
said pregnancy, to the time heretofore stipulated and agreed upon,--to live
and reside in such place or places, and in such family or families, and
with such relations, friends, and other persons within the said city of
London, as she at her own will and pleasure, notwithstanding her present
coverture, and as if she was a femme sole and unmarried,--shall think fit.-
-And this Indenture further witnesseth, That for the more effectually
carrying of the said covenant into execution, the said Walter Shandy,
merchant, doth hereby grant, bargain, sell, release, and confirm unto the
said John Dixon, and James Turner, Esqrs. their heirs, executors, and
assigns, in their actual possession now being, by virtue of an indenture of 
bargain and sale for a year to them the said John Dixon, and James Turner,
Esqrs. by him the said Walter Shandy, merchant, thereof made; which said
bargain and sale for a year, bears date the day next before the date of
these presents, and by force and virtue of the statute for transferring of
uses into possession,--All that the manor and lordship of Shandy, in the
county of. . ., with all the rights, members, and appurtenances thereof;
and all and every the messuages, houses, buildings, barns, stables,
orchards, gardens, backsides, tofts, crofts, garths, cottages, lands,
meadows, feedings, pastures, marshes, commons, woods, underwoods, drains,
fisheries, waters, and water-courses;--together with all rents, reversions,
services, annuities, fee-farms, knights fees, views of frankpledge,
escheats, reliefs, mines, quarries, goods and chattels of felons and
fugitives, felons of themselves, and put in exigent, deodands, free
warrens, and all other royalties and seigniories, rights and jurisdictions,
privileges and hereditaments whatsoever.--And also the advowson, donation,
presentation, and free disposition of the rectory or parsonage of Shandy
aforesaid, and all and every the tenths, tythes, glebe-lands.'--In three
words,--'My mother was to lay in (if she chose it) in London.'
But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on the part
of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too manifestly opened
a door to, and which indeed had never been thought of at all, but for my
uncle Toby Shandy;--a clause was added in security of my father which was
this:--'That in case my mother hereafter should, at any time, put my father
to the trouble and expence of a London journey, upon false cries and
tokens;--that for every such instance, she should forfeit all the right and
title which the covenant gave her to the next turn;--but to no more,--and
so on, toties quoties, in as effectual a manner, as if such a covenant
betwixt them had not been made.'--This, by the way, was no more than what
was reasonable;--and yet, as reasonable as it was, I have ever thought it
hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen entirely, as
it did, upon myself.
But I was begot and born to misfortunes;--for my poor mother, whether it
was wind or water--or a compound of both,--or neither;--or whether it was
simply the mere swell of imagination and fancy in her;--or how far a strong
wish and desire to have it so, might mislead her judgment;--in short,
whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter, it no way becomes me
to decide. The fact was this, That in the latter end of September 1717,
which was the year before I was born, my mother having carried my father up
to town much against the grain,--he peremptorily insisted upon the clause;-
-so that I was doom'd, by marriage-articles, to have my nose squeez'd as
flat to my face, as if the destinies had actually spun me without one.
How this event came about,--and what a train of vexatious disappointments,
in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me from the mere loss, or
rather compression, of this one single member,--shall be laid before the
reader all in due time. 
Chapter 1.XVI.
My father, as any body may naturally imagine, came down with my mother into
the country, in but a pettish kind of a humour. The first twenty or five-
and-twenty miles he did nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself,
and indeed my mother too, about the cursed expence, which he said might
every shilling of it have been saved;--then what vexed him more than every
thing else was, the provoking time of the year,--which, as I told you, was
towards the end of September, when his wall-fruit and green gages
especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for pulling:--
'Had he been whistled up to London, upon a Tom Fool's errand, in any other
month of the whole year, he should not have said three words about it.'
For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the heavy blow
he had sustain'd from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had fully
reckon'd upon in his mind, and register'd down in his pocket-book, as a
second staff for his old age, in case Bobby should fail him. 'The
disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man, than all
the money which the journey, &c. had cost him, put together,--rot the
hundred and twenty pounds,--he did not mind it a rush.'
From Stilton, all the way to Grantham, nothing in the whole affair provoked
him so much as the condolences of his friends, and the foolish figure they
should both make at church, the first Sunday;--of which, in the satirical
vehemence of his wit, now sharpen'd a little by vexation, he would give so
many humorous and provoking descriptions,--and place his rib and self in so
many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole
congregation;--that my mother declared, these two stages were so truly
tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath, from one
end to the other of them all the way.
From Grantham, till they had cross'd the Trent, my father was out of all
kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition which he fancied my
mother had put upon him in this affair--'Certainly,' he would say to
himself, over and over again, 'the woman could not be deceived herself--if
she could,--what weakness!'--tormenting word!--which led his imagination a
thorny dance, and, before all was over, play'd the duce and all with him;--
for sure as ever the word weakness was uttered, and struck full upon his
brain--so sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of
weaknesses there were;--that there was such a thing as weakness of the
body,--as well as weakness of the mind,--and then he would do nothing but
syllogize within himself for a stage or two together, How far the cause of
all these vexations might, or might not, have arisen out of himself.
In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out of
this one affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose up in
it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy journey
of it down.--In a word, as she complained to my uncle Toby, he would have
tired out the patience of any flesh alive. 
Chapter 1.XVII.
Though my father travelled homewards, as I told you, in none of the best of
moods,--pshawing and pishing all the way down,--yet he had the complaisance
to keep the worst part of the story still to himself;--which was the
resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice, which my uncle Toby's
clause in the marriage-settlement empowered him; nor was it till the very
night in which I was begot, which was thirteen months after, that she had
the least intimation of his design: when my father, happening, as you
remember, to be a little chagrin'd and out of temper,--took occasion as
they lay chatting gravely in bed afterwards, talking over what was to
come,--to let her know that she must accommodate herself as well as she
could to the bargain made between them in their marriage-deeds; which was
to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the last year's
journey.
My father was a gentleman of many virtues,--but he had a strong spice of
that in his temper, which might, or might not, add to the number.--'Tis
known by the name of perseverance in a good cause,--and of obstinacy in a
bad one: Of this my mother had so much knowledge, that she knew 'twas to
no purpose to make any remonstrance,--so she e'en resolved to sit down
quietly, and make the most of it.
Chapter 1.XVIII.
As the point was that night agreed, or rather determined, that my mother
should lye-in of me in the country, she took her measures accordingly; for
which purpose, when she was three days, or thereabouts, gone with child,
she began to cast her eyes upon the midwife, whom you have so often heard
me mention; and before the week was well got round, as the famous Dr.
Manningham was not to be had, she had come to a final determination in her
mind,--notwithstanding there was a scientific operator within so near a
call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had expressly wrote a five
shillings book upon the subject of midwifery, in which he had exposed, not
only the blunders of the sisterhood itself,--but had likewise super-added
many curious improvements for the quicker extraction of the foetus in cross
births, and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the
world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I say, was absolutely
determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul's hand but
this old woman's only.--Now this I like;--when we cannot get at the very
thing we wish--never to take up with the next best in degree to it:--no;
that's pitiful beyond description;--it is no more than a week from this
very day, in which I am now writing this book for the edification of the
world;--which is March 9, 1759,--that my dear, dear Jenny, observing I
looked a little grave, as she stood cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty
shillings a yard,--told the mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much
trouble;--and immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of ten-
pence a yard.--'Tis the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul;
only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother's case, was,
that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme, as
one in her situation might have wished, because the old midwife had really
some little claim to be depended upon,--as much, at least, as success could
give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty years in the
parish, brought every mother's son of them into the world without any one
slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her account.
These facts, tho' they had their weight, yet did not altogether satisfy
some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father's spirits in
relation to this choice.--To say nothing of the natural workings of
humanity and justice--or of the yearnings of parental and connubial love,
all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in a case
of this kind;--he felt himself concerned in a particular manner, that all
should go right in the present case;--from the accumulated sorrow he lay
open to, should any evil betide his wife and child in lying-in at Shandy-
Hall.--He knew the world judged by events, and would add to his afflictions
in such a misfortune, by loading him with the whole blame of it.--'Alas
o'day;--had Mrs. Shandy, poor gentlewoman! had but her wish in going up to
town just to lye-in and come down again;--which they say, she begged and
prayed for upon her bare knees,--and which, in my opinion, considering the
fortune which Mr. Shandy got with her,--was no such mighty matter to have
complied with, the lady and her babe might both of them have been alive at
this hour.'
This exclamation, my father knew, was unanswerable;--and yet, it was not
merely to shelter himself,--nor was it altogether for the care of his
offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about this point;--
my father had extensive views of things,--and stood moreover, as he
thought, deeply concerned in it for the publick good, from the dread he
entertained of the bad uses an ill-fated instance might be put to.
He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had
unanimously agreed and lamented, from the beginning of Queen Elizabeth's
reign down to his own time, that the current of men and money towards the
metropolis, upon one frivolous errand or another,--set in so strong,--as to
become dangerous to our civil rights,--though, by the bye,--a current was
not the image he took most delight in,--a distemper was here his favourite
metaphor, and he would run it down into a perfect allegory, by maintaining
it was identically the same in the body national as in the body natural,
where the blood and spirits were driven up into the head faster than they
could find their ways down;--a stoppage of circulation must ensue, which
was death in both cases.
There was little danger, he would say, of losing our liberties by French
politicks or French invasions;--nor was he so much in pain of a consumption
from the mass of corrupted matter and ulcerated humours in our
constitution, which he hoped was not so bad as it was imagined;--but he
verily feared, that in some violent push, we should go off, all at once, in
a state-apoplexy;--and then he would say, The Lord have mercy upon us all.
My father was never able to give the history of this distemper,--without
the remedy along with it.
'Was I an absolute prince,' he would say, pulling up his breeches with both
his hands, as he rose from his arm-chair, 'I would appoint able judges, at
every avenue of my metropolis, who should take cognizance of every fool's
business who came there;--and if, upon a fair and candid hearing, it
appeared not of weight sufficient to leave his own home, and come up, bag
and baggage, with his wife and children, farmer's sons, &c. &c. at his
backside, they should be all sent back, from constable to constable, like
vagrants as they were, to the place of their legal settlements. By this
means I shall take care, that my metropolis totter'd not thro' its own
weight;--that the head be no longer too big for the body;--that the
extremes, now wasted and pinn'd in, be restored to their due share of
nourishment, and regain with it their natural strength and beauty:--I would
effectually provide, That the meadows and corn fields of my dominions,
should laugh and sing;--that good chear and hospitality flourish once
more;--and that such weight and influence be put thereby into the hands of
the Squirality of my kingdom, as should counterpoise what I perceive my
Nobility are now taking from them.
'Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen's seats,' he would ask, with
some emotion, as he walked across the room, 'throughout so many delicious
provinces in France? Whence is it that the few remaining Chateaus amongst
them are so dismantled,--so unfurnished, and in so ruinous and desolate a
condition?--Because, Sir' (he would say) 'in that kingdom no man has any
country-interest to support;--the little interest of any kind which any man
has any where in it, is concentrated in the court, and the looks of the
Grand Monarch: by the sunshine of whose countenance, or the clouds which
pass across it, every French man lives or dies.'
Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly to guard
against the least evil accident in my mother's lying-in in the country,--
was, That any such instance would infallibly throw a balance of power, too
great already, into the weaker vessels of the gentry, in his own, or higher
stations;--which, with the many other usurped rights which that part of the
constitution was hourly establishing,--would, in the end, prove fatal to
the monarchical system of domestick government established in the first
creation of things by God.
In this point he was entirely of Sir Robert Filmer's opinion, That the
plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the eastern parts of
the world, were, originally, all stolen from that admirable pattern and
prototype of this houshold and paternal power;--which, for a century, he
said, and more, had gradually been degenerating away into a mix'd
government;--the form of which, however desirable in great combinations of
the species,--was very troublesome in small ones,--and seldom produced any
thing, that he saw, but sorrow and confusion.
For all these reasons, private and publick, put together,--my father was
for having the man-midwife by all means,--my mother, by no means. My
father begg'd and intreated, she would for once recede from her prerogative
in this matter, and suffer him to choose for her;--my mother, on the
contrary, insisted upon her privilege in this matter, to choose for
herself,--and have no mortal's help but the old woman's.--What could my
father do? He was almost at his wit's end;--talked it over with her in all
moods;--placed his arguments in all lights;--argued the matter with her
like a christian,--like a heathen,--like a husband,--like a father,--like a
patriot,--like a man:--My mother answered every thing only like a woman;
which was a little hard upon her;--for as she could not assume and fight it
out behind such a variety of characters,--'twas no fair match:--'twas seven
to one.--What could my mother do?--She had the advantage (otherwise she had
been certainly overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin personal at
the bottom, which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute the affair with
my father with so equal an advantage,--that both sides sung Te Deum. In a
word, my mother was to have the old woman,--and the operator was to have
licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father and my uncle Toby Shandy
in the back parlour,--for which he was to be paid five guineas.
I must beg leave, before I finish this chapter, to enter a caveat in the
breast of my fair reader;--and it is this,--Not to take it absolutely for
granted, from an unguarded word or two which I have dropp'd in it,--'That I
am a married man.'--I own, the tender appellation of my dear, dear Jenny,--
with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge, interspersed here and there,
might, naturally enough, have misled the most candid judge in the world
into such a determination against me.--All I plead for, in this case,
Madam, is strict justice, and that you do so much of it, to me as well as
to yourself,--as not to prejudge, or receive such an impression of me, till
you have better evidence, than, I am positive, at present can be produced
against me.--Not that I can be so vain or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire
you should therefore think, that my dear, dear Jenny is my kept mistress;--
no,--that would be flattering my character in the other extreme, and giving
it an air of freedom, which, perhaps, it has no kind of right to. All I
contend for, is the utter impossibility, for some volumes, that you, or the
most penetrating spirit upon earth, should know how this matter really
stands.--It is not impossible, but that my dear, dear Jenny! tender as the
appellation is, may be my child.--Consider,--I was born in the year
eighteen.--Nor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in the
supposition, that my dear Jenny may be my friend.--Friend!--My friend.--
Surely, Madam, a friendship between the two sexes may subsist, and be
supported without--Fy! Mr. Shandy:--Without any thing, Madam, but that
tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship, where there
is a difference of sex. Let me intreat you to study the pure and
sentimental parts of the best French Romances;--it will really, Madam,
astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expressions this
delicious sentiment, which I have the honour to speak of, is dress'd out.
Chapter 1.XIX.
I would sooner undertake to explain the hardest problem in geometry, than
pretend to account for it, that a gentleman of my father's great good
sense,--knowing, as the reader must have observed him, and curious too in
philosophy,--wise also in political reasoning,--and in polemical (as he
will find) no way ignorant,--could be capable of entertaining a notion in
his head, so out of the common track,--that I fear the reader, when I come
to mention it to him, if he is the least of a cholerick temper, will
immediatly throw the book by; if mercurial, he will laugh most heartily at
it;--and if he is of a grave and saturnine cast, he will, at first sight,
absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant; and that was in respect to
the choice and imposition of christian names, on which he thought a great
deal more depended than what superficial minds were capable of conceiving.
His opinion, in this matter, was, That there was a strange kind of magick
bias, which good or bad names, as he called them, irresistibly impressed
upon our characters and conduct.
The hero of Cervantes argued not the point with more seriousness,--nor had
he more faith,--or more to say on the powers of necromancy in dishonouring
his deeds,--or on Dulcinea's name, in shedding lustre upon them, than my
father had on those of Trismegistus or Archimedes, on the one hand--or of
Nyky and Simkin on the other. How many Caesars and Pompeys, he would say,
by mere inspiration of the names, have been rendered worthy of them? And
how many, he would add, are there, who might have done exceeding well in
the world, had not their characters and spirits been totally depressed and
Nicodemus'd into nothing?
I see plainly, Sir, by your looks, (or as the case happened) my father
would say--that you do not heartily subscribe to this opinion of mine,--
which, to those, he would add, who have not carefully sifted it to the
bottom,--I own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in it;--and
yet, my dear Sir, if I may presume to know your character, I am morally
assured, I should hazard little in stating a case to you, not as a party in
the dispute,--but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon it to your own
good sense and candid disquisition in this matter;--you are a person free
from as many narrow prejudices of education as most men;--and, if I may
presume to penetrate farther into you,--of a liberality of genius above
bearing down an opinion, merely because it wants friends. Your son,--your
dear son,--from whose sweet and open temper you have so much to expect.--
Your Billy, Sir!--would you, for the world, have called him Judas?--Would
you, my dear Sir, he would say, laying his hand upon your breast, with the
genteelest address,--and in that soft and irresistible piano of voice,
which the nature of the argumentum ad hominem absolutely requires,--Would
you, Sir, if a Jew of a godfather had proposed the name for your child, and
offered you his purse along with it, would you have consented to such a
desecration of him?--O my God! he would say, looking up, if I know your
temper right, Sir,--you are incapable of it;--you would have trampled upon
the offer;--you would have thrown the temptation at the tempter's head with
abhorrence.
Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that generous
contempt of money, which you shew me in the whole transaction, is really
noble;--and what renders it more so, is the principle of it;--the workings
of a parent's love upon the truth and conviction of this very hypothesis,
namely, That was your son called Judas,--the forbid and treacherous idea,
so inseparable from the name, would have accompanied him through life like
his shadow, and, in the end, made a miser and a rascal of him, in spite,
Sir, of your example.
I never knew a man able to answer this argument.--But, indeed, to speak of
my father as he was;--he was certainly irresistible;--both in his orations
and disputations;--he was born an orator;--(Greek).--Persuasion hung upon
his lips, and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up in
him,--and, withal, he had so shrewd a guess at the weaknesses and passions
of his respondent,--that Nature might have stood up and said,--'This man is
eloquent.'--In short, whether he was on the weak or the strong side of the
question, 'twas hazardous in either case to attack him.--And yet, 'tis
strange, he had never read Cicero, nor Quintilian de Oratore, nor
Isocrates, nor Aristotle, nor Longinus, amongst the antients;--nor Vossius,
nor Skioppius, nor Ramus, nor Farnaby, amongst the moderns;--and what is
more astonishing, he had never in his whole life the least light or spark
of subtilty struck into his mind, by one single lecture upon Crackenthorp
or Burgersdicius or any Dutch logician or commentator;--he knew not so much
as in what the difference of an argument ad ignorantiam, and an argument ad
hominem consisted; so that I well remember, when he went up along with me
to enter my name at Jesus College in. . .,--it was a matter of just wonder
with my worthy tutor, and two or three fellows of that learned society,--
that a man who knew not so much as the names of his tools, should be able
to work after that fashion with them.
To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my father was,
however, perpetually forced upon;--for he had a thousand little sceptical
notions of the comick kind to defend--most of which notions, I verily
believe, at first entered upon the footing of mere whims, and of a vive la
Bagatelle; and as such he would make merry with them for half an hour or
so, and having sharpened his wit upon them, dismiss them till another day.
I mention this, not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon the
progress and establishment of my father's many odd opinions,--but as a
warning to the learned reader against the indiscreet reception of such
guests, who, after a free and undisturbed entrance, for some years, into
our brains,--at length claim a kind of settlement there,--working sometimes
like yeast;--but more generally after the manner of the gentle passion,
beginning in jest,--but ending in downright earnest.
Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father's notions--or
that his judgment, at length, became the dupe of his wit;--or how far, in
many of his notions, he might, though odd, be absolutely right;--the
reader, as he comes at them, shall decide. All that I maintain here, is,
that in this one, of the influence of christian names, however it gained
footing, he was serious;--he was all uniformity;--he was systematical, and,
like all systematic reasoners, he would move both heaven and earth, and
twist and torture every thing in nature to support his hypothesis. In a
word I repeat it over again;--he was serious;--and, in consequence of it,
he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw people, especially of
condition, who should have known better,--as careless and as indifferent
about the name they imposed upon their child,--or more so, than in the
choice of Ponto or Cupid for their puppy-dog.
This, he would say, look'd ill;--and had, moreover, this particular
aggravation in it, viz. That when once a vile name was wrongfully or
injudiciously given, 'twas not like the case of a man's character, which,
when wrong'd, might hereafter be cleared;--and, possibly, some time or
other, if not in the man's life, at least after his death,--be, somehow or
other, set to rights with the world: But the injury of this, he would say,
could never be undone;--nay, he doubted even whether an act of parliament
could reach it:--He knew as well as you, that the legislature assumed a
power over surnames;--but for very strong reasons, which he could give, it
had never yet adventured, he would say, to go a step farther.
It was observable, that tho' my father, in consequence of this opinion,
had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and dislikings towards
certain names;--that there were still numbers of names which hung so
equally in the balance before him, that they were absolutely indifferent to
him. Jack, Dick, and Tom were of this class: These my father called
neutral names;--affirming of them, without a satire, That there had been as
many knaves and fools, at least, as wise and good men, since the world
began, who had indifferently borne them;--so that, like equal forces acting
against each other in contrary directions, he thought they mutually
destroyed each other's effects; for which reason, he would often declare,
He would not give a cherry-stone to choose amongst them. Bob, which was my
brother's name, was another of these neutral kinds of christian names,
which operated very little either way; and as my father happen'd to be at
Epsom, when it was given him,--he would oft-times thank Heaven it was no
worse. Andrew was something like a negative quantity in Algebra with him;-
-'twas worse, he said, than nothing.--William stood pretty high:--Numps
again was low with him:--and Nick, he said, was the Devil.
But of all names in the universe he had the most unconquerable aversion for
Tristram;--he had the lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of any
thing in the world,--thinking it could possibly produce nothing in rerum
natura, but what was extremely mean and pitiful: So that in the midst of a
dispute on the subject, in which, by the bye, he was frequently involved,--
he would sometimes break off in a sudden and spirited Epiphonema, or rather
Erotesis, raised a third, and sometimes a full fifth above the key of the
discourse,--and demand it categorically of his antagonist, Whether he would
take upon him to say, he had ever remembered,--whether he had ever read,--
or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, called Tristram,
performing any thing great or worth recording?--No,--he would say,--
Tristram!--The thing is impossible.
What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to publish this
notion of his to the world? Little boots it to the subtle speculatist to
stand single in his opinions,--unless he gives them proper vent:--It was
the identical thing which my father did:--for in the year sixteen, which
was two years before I was born, he was at the pains of writing an express
Dissertation simply upon the word Tristram,--shewing the world, with great
candour and modesty, the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name.
When this story is compared with the title-page,--Will not the gentle
reader pity my father from his soul?--to see an orderly and well-disposed
gentleman, who tho' singular,--yet inoffensive in his notions,--so played
upon in them by cross purposes;--to look down upon the stage, and see him
baffled and overthrown in all his little systems and wishes; to behold a
train of events perpetually falling out against him, and in so critical and
cruel a way, as if they had purposedly been plann'd and pointed against
him, merely to insult his speculations.--In a word, to behold such a one,
in his old age, ill-fitted for troubles, ten times in a day suffering
sorrow;--ten times in a day calling the child of his prayers Tristram!--
Melancholy dissyllable of sound! which, to his ears, was unison to
Nincompoop, and every name vituperative under heaven.--By his ashes! I
swear it,--if ever malignant spirit took pleasure, or busied itself in
traversing the purposes of mortal man,--it must have been here;--and if it
was not necessary I should be born before I was christened, I would this
moment give the reader an account of it.
Chapter 1.XX.
--How could you, Madam, be so inattentive in reading the last chapter? I
told you in it, That my mother was not a papist.--Papist! You told me no
such thing, Sir.--Madam, I beg leave to repeat it over again, that I told
you as plain, at least, as words, by direct inference, could tell you such
a thing.--Then, Sir, I must have miss'd a page.--No, Madam, you have not
miss'd a word.--Then I was asleep, Sir.--My pride, Madam, cannot allow you
that refuge.--Then, I declare, I know nothing at all about the matter.--
That, Madam, is the very fault I lay to your charge; and as a punishment
for it, I do insist upon it, that you immediately turn back, that is as
soon as you get to the next full stop, and read the whole chapter over
again. I have imposed this penance upon the lady, neither out of
wantonness nor cruelty; but from the best of motives; and therefore shall
make her no apology for it when she returns back:--'Tis to rebuke a vicious
taste, which has crept into thousands besides herself,--of reading straight
forwards, more in quest of the adventures, than of the deep erudition and
knowledge which a book of this cast, if read over as it should be, would
infallibly impart with them--The mind should be accustomed to make wise
reflections, and draw curious conclusions as it goes along; the habitude of
which made Pliny the younger affirm, 'That he never read a book so bad, but
he drew some profit from it.' The stories of Greece and Rome, run over
without this turn and application,--do less service, I affirm it, than the
history of Parismus and Parismenus, or of the Seven Champions of England,
read with it.
--But here comes my fair lady. Have you read over again the chapter,
Madam, as I desired you?--You have: And did you not observe the passage,
upon the second reading, which admits the inference?--Not a word like it! 
Then, Madam, be pleased to ponder well the last line but one of the
chapter, where I take upon me to say, 'It was necessary I should be born
before I was christen'd.' Had my mother, Madam, been a Papist, that
consequence did not follow. (The Romish Rituals direct the baptizing of
the child, in cases of danger, before it is born;--but upon this proviso,
That some part or other of the child's body be seen by the baptizer:--But
the Doctors of the Sorbonne, by a deliberation held amongst them, April 10,
1733,--have enlarged the powers of the midwives, by determining, That
though no part of the child's body should appear,--that baptism shall,
nevertheless, be administered to it by injection,--par le moyen d'une
petite canulle,--Anglice a squirt.--'Tis very strange that St. Thomas
Aquinas, who had so good a mechanical head, both for tying and untying the
knots of school-divinity,--should, after so much pains bestowed upon this,-
-give up the point at last, as a second La chose impossible,--'Infantes in
maternis uteris existentes (quoth St. Thomas!) baptizari possunt nullo
modo.'--O Thomas! Thomas! If the reader has the curiosity to see the
question upon baptism by injection, as presented to the Doctors of the
Sorbonne, with their consultation thereupon, it is as follows.)
It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine, but more so to the
Republick of letters;--so that my own is quite swallowed up in the
consideration of it,--that this self-same vile pruriency for fresh
adventures in all things, has got so strongly into our habit and humour,--
and so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience of our
concupiscence that way,--that nothing but the gross and more carnal parts
of a composition will go down:--The subtle hints and sly communications of
science fly off, like spirits upwards,--the heavy moral escapes downwards;
and both the one and the other are as much lost to the world, as if they
were still left in the bottom of the ink-horn.
I wish the male-reader has not pass'd by many a one, as quaint and curious
as this one, in which the female-reader has been detected. I wish it may
have its effects;--and that all good people, both male and female, from
example, may be taught to think as well as read.
Memoire presente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne 
Vide Deventer. Paris Edit. 4to, 1734, p. 366.
Un Chirurgien Accoucheur, represente a Messieurs les Docteurs de Sorbonne,
qu'il y a des cas, quoique tres rares, ou une mere ne scauroit accoucher, &
meme ou l'enfant est tellement renferme dans le sein de sa mere, qu'il ne
fait paroitre aucune partie de son corps, ce qui seroit un cas, suivant les
Rituels, de lui conferer, du moins sous condition, le bapteme. Le
Chirurgien, qui consulte, pretend, par le moyen d'une petite canulle, de
pouvoir baptiser immediatement l'enfant, sans faire aucun tort a la mere.--
Il demand si ce moyen, qu'il vient de proposer, est permis & legitime, &
s'il peut s'en servir dans les cas qu'il vient d'exposer.
Reponse
Le Conseil estime, que la question proposee souffre de grandes difficultes.
Les Theologiens posent d'un cote pour principe, que le bapteme, qui est une
naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere naissance; il faut etre ne dans
le monde, pour renaitre en Jesus Christ, comme ils l'enseignent. S.
Thomas, 3 part. quaest. 88 artic. II. suit cette doctrine comme une verite
constante; l'on ne peut, dit ce S. Docteur, baptiser les enfans qui sont
renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, & S. Thomas est fonde sur ce, que
les enfans ne sont point nes, & ne peuvent etre comptes parmi les autres
hommes; d'ou il conclud, qu'ils ne peuvent etre l'objet d'une action
exterieure, pour recevoir par leur ministere, les sacremens necessaires au
salut: Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodierunt in lucem ut
cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant; unde non possunt subjici actioni humanae,
ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem. Les rituels
ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les theologiens ont etabli sur les memes
matieres, & ils deffendent tous d'une maniere uniforme, de baptiser les
enfans qui sont renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, s'ils ne sont
paroitre quelque partie de leurs corps. Le concours des theologiens, & des
rituels, qui sont les regles des dioceses, paroit former une autorite qui
termine la question presente; cependant le conseil de conscience
considerant d'un cote, que le raisonnement des theologiens est uniquement
fonde sur une raison de convenance, & que la deffense des rituels suppose
que l'on ne peut baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermes dans le
sein de leurs meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; & d'un
autre cote, considerant que les memes theologiens enseignent, que l'on peut
risquer les sacremens que Jesus Christ a etablis comme des moyens faciles,
mais necessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; & d'ailleurs estimant, que les
enfans renfermes dans le sein de leurs meres, pourroient etre capables de
salut, parcequ'ils sont capables de damnation;--pour ces considerations, &
en egard a l'expose, suivant lequel on assure avoir trouve un moyen certain
de baptiser ces enfans ainsi renfermes, sans faire aucun tort a la mere, le
Conseil estime que l'on pourroit se servir du moyen propose, dans la
confiance qu'il a, que Dieu n'a point laisse ces sortes d'enfans sans
aucuns secours, & supposant, comme il est expose, que le moyen dont il
s'agit est propre a leur procurer le bapteme; cependant comme il s'agiroit,
en autorisant la pratique proposee, de changer une regle universellement
etablie, le Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s'addresser a son
eveque, & a qui il appartient de juger de l'utilite, & du danger du moyen
propose, & comme, sous le bon plaisir de l'eveque, le Conseil estime qu'il
faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d'expliquer les regles de
l'eglise, & d'y deroger dans le cas, ou la loi ne scauroit obliger, quelque
sage & quelque utile que paroisse la maniere de baptiser dont il s'agit, le
Conseil ne pourroit l'approver sans le concours de ces deux autorites. On
conseile au moins a celui qui consulte, de s'addresser a son eveque, & de
lui faire part de la presente decision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans
les raisons sur lesquelles les docteurs soussignes s'appuyent, il puisse
etre autorise dans le cas de necessite, ou il risqueroit trop d'attendre
que la permission fut demandee & accordee d'employer le moyen qu'il propose
si avantageux au salut de l'enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant que
l'on pourroit s'en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont il
s'agit, venoient au monde, contre l'esperance de ceux qui se seroient
servis du meme moyen, il seroit necessaire de les baptiser sous condition;
& en cela le Conseil se conforme a tous les rituels, qui en autorisant le
bapteme d'un enfant qui fait paroitre quelque partie de son corps,
enjoignent neantmoins, & ordonnent de le baptiser sous condition, s'il
vient heureusement au monde.

Mr. Tristram Shandy's compliments to Messrs. Le Moyne, De Romigny, and De
Marcilly; hopes they all rested well the night after so tiresome a
consultation.--He begs to know, whether after the ceremony of marriage, and
before that of consummation, the baptizing all the Homunculi at once,
slapdash, by injection, would not be a shorter and safer cut still; on
condition, as above, That if the Homunculi do well, and come safe into the
world after this, that each and every of them shall be baptized again (sous
condition)--And provided, in the second place, That the thing can be done,
which Mr. Shandy apprehends it may, par le moyen d'une petite canulle, and
sans faire aucune tort au pere.
Chapter 1.XXI.
--I wonder what's all that noise, and running backwards and forwards for,
above stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself, after an hour and a
half's silence, to my uncle Toby,--who, you must know, was sitting on the
opposite side of the fire, smoaking his social pipe all the time, in mute
contemplation of a new pair of black plush-breeches which he had got on:--
What can they be doing, brother?--quoth my father,--we can scarce hear
ourselves talk.
I think, replied my uncle Toby, taking his pipe from his mouth, and
striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of his left thumb,
as he began his sentence,--I think, says he:--But to enter rightly into my
uncle Toby's sentiments upon this matter, you must be made to enter first a
little into his character, the out-lines of which I shall just give you,
and then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well again.
Pray what was that man's name,--for I write in such a hurry, I have no time
to recollect or look for it,--who first made the observation, 'That there
was great inconstancy in our air and climate?' Whoever he was, 'twas a
just and good observation in him.--But the corollary drawn from it, namely,
'That it is this which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and
whimsical characters;'--that was not his;--it was found out by another man,
at least a century and a half after him: Then again,--that this copious
store-house of original materials, is the true and natural cause that our
Comedies are so much better than those of France, or any others that either
have, or can be wrote upon the Continent:--that discovery was not fully
made till about the middle of King William's reign,--when the great Dryden,
in writing one of his long prefaces, (if I mistake not) most fortunately
hit upon it. Indeed toward the latter end of queen Anne, the great Addison
began to patronize the notion, and more fully explained it to the world in
one or two of his Spectators;--but the discovery was not his.--Then,
fourthly and lastly, that this strange irregularity in our climate,
producing so strange an irregularity in our characters,--doth thereby, in
some sort, make us amends, by giving us somewhat to make us merry with when
the weather will not suffer us to go out of doors,--that observation is my
own;--and was struck out by me this very rainy day, March 26, 1759, and
betwixt the hours of nine and ten in the morning.
Thus--thus, my fellow-labourers and associates in this great harvest of our
learning, now ripening before our eyes; thus it is, by slow steps of casual
increase, that our knowledge physical, metaphysical, physiological,
polemical, nautical, mathematical, aenigmatical, technical, biographical,
romantical, chemical, and obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it,
(most of 'em ending as these do, in ical) have for these two last centuries
and more, gradually been creeping upwards towards that Akme of their
perfections, from which, if we may form a conjecture from the advances of
these last seven years, we cannot possibly be far off.
When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all kind of
writings whatsoever;--the want of all kind of writing will put an end to
all kind of reading;--and that in time, As war begets poverty; poverty
peace,--must, in course, put an end to all kind of knowledge,--and then--we
shall have all to begin over again; or, in other words, be exactly where we
started.
--Happy! Thrice happy times! I only wish that the aera of my begetting,
as well as the mode and manner of it, had been a little alter'd,--or that
it could have been put off, with any convenience to my father or mother,
for some twenty or five-and-twenty years longer, when a man in the literary
world might have stood some chance.--
But I forget my uncle Toby, whom all this while we have left knocking the
ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.
His humour was of that particular species, which does honour to our
atmosphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one of
the first-rate productions of it, had not there appeared too many strong
lines in it of a family-likeness, which shewed that he derived the
singularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or water, or
any modifications or combinations of them whatever: And I have, therefore,
oft-times wondered, that my father, tho' I believe he had his reasons for
it, upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity, in my course, when I
was a boy,--should never once endeavour to account for them in this way: 
for all the Shandy Family were of an original character throughout:--I mean
the males,--the females had no character at all,--except, indeed, my great
aunt Dinah, who, about sixty years ago, was married and got with child by
the coachman, for which my father, according to his hypothesis of christian
names, would often say, She might thank her godfathers and godmothers.
It will seem strange,--and I would as soon think of dropping a riddle in
the reader's way, which is not my interest to do, as set him upon guessing
how it could come to pass, that an event of this kind, so many years after
it had happened, should be reserved for the interruption of the peace and
unity, which otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my father and my
uncle Toby. One would have thought, that the whole force of the misfortune
should have spent and wasted itself in the family at first,--as is
generally the case.--But nothing ever wrought with our family after the
ordinary way. Possibly at the very time this happened, it might have
something else to afflict it; and as afflictions are sent down for our
good, and that as this had never done the Shandy Family any good at all, it
might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances should give it an
opportunity to discharge its office.--Observe, I determine nothing upon
this.--My way is ever to point out to the curious, different tracts of
investigation, to come at the first springs of the events I tell;--not with
a pedantic Fescue,--or in the decisive manner or Tacitus, who outwits
himself and his reader;--but with the officious humility of a heart devoted
to the assistance merely of the inquisitive;--to them I write,--and by them
I shall be read,--if any such reading as this could be supposed to hold out
so long,--to the very end of the world.
Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father and
uncle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what direction it exerted
itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them, after it
began to operate, is what I am able to explain with great exactness, and is
as follows:
My uncle Toby Shandy, Madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues which
usually constitute the character of a man of honour and rectitude,--
possessed one in a very eminent degree, which is seldom or never put into
the catalogue; and that was a most extreme and unparallel'd modesty of
nature;--though I correct the word nature, for this reason, that I may not
prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing, and that is, Whether
this modesty of his was natural or acquir'd.--Whichever way my uncle Toby
came by it, 'twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it; and that
is, Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so unhappy as to have very
little choice in them,--but to things;--and this kind of modesty so
possessed him, and it arose to such a height in him, as almost to equal, if
such a thing could be, even the modesty of a woman: That female nicety,
Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your sex, which makes
you so much the awe of ours.
You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle Toby had contracted all this from
this very source;--that he had spent a great part of his time in converse
with your sex, and that from a thorough knowledge of you, and the force of
imitation which such fair examples render irresistible, he had acquired
this amiable turn of mind.
I wish I could say so,--for unless it was with his sister-in-law, my
father's wife and my mother--my uncle Toby scarce exchanged three words
with the sex in as many years;--no, he got it, Madam, by a blow.--A blow!--
Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow from a stone, broke off by a ball from
the parapet of a horn-work at the siege of Namur, which struck full upon my
uncle Toby's groin.--Which way could that effect it? The story of that,
Madam, is long and interesting;--but it would be running my history all
upon heaps to give it you here.--'Tis for an episode hereafter; and every
circumstance relating to it, in its proper place, shall be faithfully laid
before you:--'Till then, it is not in my power to give farther light into
this matter, or say more than what I have said already,--That my uncle Toby
was a gentleman of unparallel'd modesty, which happening to be somewhat
subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family pride,--
they both so wrought together within him, that he could never bear to hear
the affair of my aunt Dinah touch'd upon, but with the greatest emotion.--
The least hint of it was enough to make the blood fly into his face;--but
when my father enlarged upon the story in mixed companies, which the
illustration of his hypothesis frequently obliged him to do,--the
unfortunate blight of one of the fairest branches of the family, would set
my uncle Toby's honour and modesty o'bleeding; and he would often take my
father aside, in the greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell
him, he would give him any thing in the world, only to let the story rest.
My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle Toby,
that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done any thing
in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir'd of another, to
have made my uncle Toby's heart easy in this, or any other point. But this
lay out of his power. 
--My father, as I told you was a philosopher in grain,--speculative,--
systematical;--and my aunt Dinah's affair was a matter of as much
consequence to him, as the retrogradation of the planets to Copernicus:--
The backslidings of Venus in her orbit fortified the Copernican system,
called so after his name; and the backslidings of my aunt Dinah in her
orbit, did the same service in establishing my father's system, which, I
trust, will for ever hereafter be called the Shandean System, after his.
In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice a sense of
shame as any man whatever;--and neither he, nor, I dare say, Copernicus,
would have divulged the affair in either case, or have taken the least
notice of it to the world, but for the obligations they owed, as they
thought, to truth.--Amicus Plato, my father would say, construing the words
to my uncle Toby, as he went along, Amicus Plato; that is, Dinah was my
aunt;--sed magis amica veritas--but Truth is my sister.
This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the source
of many a fraternal squabble. The one could not bear to hear the tale of
family disgrace recorded,--and the other would scarce ever let a day pass
to an end without some hint at it.
For God's sake, my uncle Toby would cry,--and for my sake, and for all our
sakes, my dear brother Shandy,--do let this story of our aunt's and her
ashes sleep in peace;--how can you,--how can you have so little feeling and
compassion for the character of our family?--What is the character of a
family to an hypothesis? my father would reply.--Nay, if you come to that--
what is the life of a family?--The life of a family!--my uncle Toby would
say, throwing himself back in his arm chair, and lifting up his hands, his
eyes, and one leg--Yes, the life,--my father would say, maintaining his
point. How many thousands of 'em are there every year that come cast away,
(in all civilized countries at least)--and considered as nothing but common
air, in competition of an hypothesis. In my plain sense of things, my
uncle Toby would answer,--every such instance is downright Murder, let who
will commit it.--There lies your mistake, my father would reply;--for, in
Foro Scientiae there is no such thing as Murder,--'tis only Death, brother.
My uncle Toby would never offer to answer this by any other kind of
argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of Lillebullero.--You
must know it was the usual channel thro' which his passions got vent, when
any thing shocked or surprized him:--but especially when any thing, which
he deem'd very absurd, was offered.
As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon them,
that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to this particular
species of argument.--I here take the liberty to do it myself, for two
reasons. First, That, in order to prevent all confusion in disputes, it
may stand as much distinguished for ever, from every other species of
argument--as the Argumentum ad Verecundiam, ex Absurdo, ex Fortiori, or any
other argument whatsoever:--And, secondly, That it may be said by my
children's children, when my head is laid to rest,--that their learn'd
grandfather's head had been busied to as much purpose once, as other
people's;--That he had invented a name, and generously thrown it into the
Treasury of the Ars Logica, for one of the most unanswerable arguments in
the whole science. And, if the end of disputation is more to silence than
convince,--they may add, if they please, to one of the best arguments too.
I do, therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command, That it be
known and distinguished by the name and title of the Argumentum
Fistulatorium, and no other;--and that it rank hereafter with the
Argumentum Baculinum and the Argumentum ad Crumenam, and for ever hereafter
be treated of in the same chapter. 
As for the Argumentum Tripodium, which is never used but by the woman
against the man;--and the Argumentum ad Rem, which, contrarywise, is made
use of by the man only against the woman;--As these two are enough in
conscience for one lecture;--and, moreover, as the one is the best answer
to the other,--let them likewise be kept apart, and be treated of in a
place by themselves.
Chapter 1.XXII.
The learned Bishop Hall, I mean the famous Dr. Joseph Hall, who was Bishop
of Exeter in King James the First's reign, tells us in one of Decads, at
the end of his divine art of meditation, imprinted at London, in the year
1610, by John Beal, dwelling in Aldersgate-street, 'That it is an
abominable thing for a man to commend himself;'--and I really think it is
so.
And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a masterly kind of
a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found out;--I think it is full
as abominable, that a man should lose the honour of it, and go out of the
world with the conceit of it rotting in his head.
This is precisely my situation.
For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into, as in all
my digressions (one only excepted) there is a master-stroke of digressive
skill, the merit of which has all along, I fear, been over-looked by my
reader,--not for want of penetration in him,--but because 'tis an
excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a digression;--and it
is this: That tho' my digressions are all fair, as you observe,--and that
I fly off from what I am about, as far, and as often too, as any writer in
Great Britain; yet I constantly take care to order affairs so that my main
business does not stand still in my absence.
I was just going, for example, to have given you the great out-lines of my
uncle Toby's most whimsical character;--when my aunt Dinah and the coachman
came across us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into the very
heart of the planetary system: Notwithstanding all this, you perceive that
the drawing of my uncle Toby's character went on gently all the time;--not
the great contours of it,--that was impossible,--but some familiar strokes
and faint designations of it, were here and there touch'd on, as we went
along, so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle Toby now than
you was before.
By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by itself; two
contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconciled, which were thought
to be at variance with each other. In a word, my work is digressive, and
it is progressive too,--and at the same time.
This, Sir, is a very different story from that of the earth's moving round
her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her progress in her elliptick orbit
which brings about the year, and constitutes that variety and vicissitude
of seasons we enjoy;--though I own it suggested the thought,--as I believe
the greatest of our boasted improvements and discoveries have come from
such trifling hints.
Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine;--they are the life, the soul
of reading!--take them out of this book, for instance,--you might as well
take the book along with them;--one cold eternal winter would reign in
every page of it; restore them to the writer;--he steps forth like a
bridegroom,--bids All-hail; brings in variety, and forbids the appetite to
fail.
All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them, so as to
be not only for the advantage of the reader, but also of the author, whose
distress, in this matter, is truly pitiable: For, if he begins a
digression,--from that moment, I observe, his whole work stands stock
still;--and if he goes on with his main work,--then there is an end of his
digression.
--This is vile work.--For which reason, from the beginning of this, you
see, I have constructed the main work and the adventitious parts of it with
such intersections, and have so complicated and involved the digressive and
progressive movements, one wheel within another, that the whole machine, in
general, has been kept a-going;--and, what's more, it shall be kept a-going
these forty years, if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me so long
with life and good spirits.
Chapter 1.XXIII.
I have a strong propensity in me to begin this chapter very nonsensically,
and I will not balk my fancy.--Accordingly I set off thus:
If the fixture of Momus's glass in the human breast, according to the
proposed emendation of that arch-critick, had taken place,--first, This
foolish consequence would certainly have followed,--That the very wisest
and very gravest of us all, in one coin or other, must have paid window-
money every day of our lives.
And, secondly, that had the said glass been there set up, nothing more
would have been wanting, in order to have taken a man's character, but to
have taken a chair and gone softly, as you would to a dioptrical bee-hive,
and look'd in,--view'd the soul stark naked;--observed all her motions,--
her machinations;--traced all her maggots from their first engendering to
their crawling forth;--watched her loose in her frisks, her gambols, her
capricios; and after some notice of her more solemn deportment, consequent
upon such frisks, &c.--then taken your pen and ink and set down nothing but
what you had seen, and could have sworn to:--But this is an advantage not
to be had by the biographer in this planet;--in the planet Mercury (belike)
it may be so, if not better still for him;--for there the intense heat of
the country, which is proved by computators, from its vicinity to the sun,
to be more than equal to that of red-hot iron,--must, I think, long ago
have vitrified the bodies of the inhabitants, (as the efficient cause) to
suit them for the climate (which is the final cause;) so that betwixt them
both, all the tenements of their souls, from top to bottom, may be nothing
else, for aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary, but one
fine transparent body of clear glass (bating the umbilical knot)--so that,
till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably wrinkled, whereby the rays of
light, in passing through them, become so monstrously refracted,--or return
reflected from their surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye, that a
man cannot be seen through;--his soul might as well, unless for mere
ceremony, or the trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave her,--
might, upon all other accounts, I say, as well play the fool out o'doors as
in her own house.
But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of this
earth;--our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapt up here in a
dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so that, if we would come
to the specific characters of them, we must go some other way to work.
Many, in good truth, are the ways, which human wit has been forced to take,
to do this thing with exactness.
Some, for instance, draw all their characters with wind-instruments.--
Virgil takes notice of that way in the affair of Dido and Aeneas;--but it
is as fallacious as the breath of fame;--and, moreover, bespeaks a narrow
genius. I am not ignorant that the Italians pretend to a mathematical
exactness in their designations of one particular sort of character among
them, from the forte or piano of a certain wind-instrument they use,--which
they say is infallible.--I dare not mention the name of the instrument in
this place;--'tis sufficient we have it amongst us,--but never think of
making a drawing by it;--this is aenigmatical, and intended to be so, at
least ad populum:--And therefore, I beg, Madam, when you come here, that
you read on as fast as you can, and never stop to make any inquiry about
it.
There are others again, who will draw a man's character from no other helps
in the world, but merely from his evacuations;--but this often gives a very
incorrect outline,--unless, indeed, you take a sketch of his repletions
too; and by correcting one drawing from the other, compound one good figure
out of them both.
I should have no objection to this method, but that I think it must smell
too strong of the lamp,--and be render'd still more operose, by forcing you
to have an eye to the rest of his Non-naturals.--Why the most natural
actions of a man's life should be called his Non-naturals,--is another
question.
There are others, fourthly, who disdain every one of these expedients;--not
from any fertility of their own, but from the various ways of doing it,
which they have borrowed from the honourable devices which the Pentagraphic
Brethren (Pentagraph, an instrument to copy Prints and Pictures
mechanically, and in any proportion.) of the brush have shewn in taking
copies.--These, you must know, are your great historians.
One of these you will see drawing a full length character against the
light;--that's illiberal,--dishonest,--and hard upon the character of the
man who sits.
Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the Camera;--that
is most unfair of all, because, there you are sure to be represented in
some of your most ridiculous attitudes.
To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle Toby's
character, I am determined to draw it by no mechanical help whatever;--nor
shall my pencil be guided by any one wind-instrument which ever was blown
upon, either on this, or on the other side of the Alps;--nor will I
consider either his repletions or his discharges,--or touch upon his Non-
naturals; but, in a word, I will draw my uncle Toby's character from his
Hobby-Horse.
Chapter 1.XXIV.
If I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for
my uncle Toby's character,--I would here previously have convinced him that
there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with, as that which I
have pitch'd upon.
A man and his Hobby-Horse, tho' I cannot say that they act and re-act
exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each
other: Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind;
and my opinion rather is, that there is something in it more of the manner
of electrified bodies,--and that, by means of the heated parts of the
rider, which come immediately into contact with the back of the Hobby-
Horse,--by long journies and much friction, it so happens, that the body of
the rider is at length fill'd as full of Hobby-Horsical matter as it can
hold;--so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the
nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and
character of the other. 
Now the Hobby-Horse which my uncle Toby always rode upon, was in my opinion
an Hobby-Horse well worth giving a description of, if it was only upon the
score of his great singularity;--for you might have travelled from York to
Dover,--from Dover to Penzance in Cornwall, and from Penzance to York back
again, and not have seen such another upon the road; or if you had seen
such a one, whatever haste you had been in, you must infallibly have
stopp'd to have taken a view of him. Indeed, the gait and figure of him
was so strange, and so utterly unlike was he, from his head to his tail, to
any one of the whole species, that it was now and then made a matter of
dispute,--whether he was really a Hobby-Horse or no: But as the
Philosopher would use no other argument to the Sceptic, who disputed with
him against the reality of motion, save that of rising up upon his legs,
and walking across the room;--so would my uncle Toby use no other argument
to prove his Hobby-Horse was a Hobby-Horse indeed, but by getting upon his
back and riding him about;--leaving the world, after that, to determine the
point as it thought fit.
In good truth, my uncle Toby mounted him with so much pleasure, and he
carried my uncle Toby so well,--that he troubled his head very little with
what the world either said or thought about it.
It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of him:--But to
go on regularly, I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first,
how my uncle Toby came by him.
Chapter 1.XXV.
The wound in my uncle Toby's groin, which he received at the siege of
Namur, rendering him unfit for the service, it was thought expedient he
should return to England, in order, if possible, to be set to rights.
He was four years totally confined,--part of it to his bed, and all of it
to his room: and in the course of his cure, which was all that time in
hand, suffer'd unspeakable miseries,--owing to a succession of exfoliations
from the os pubis, and the outward edge of that part of the coxendix called
the os illium,--both which bones were dismally crush'd, as much by the
irregularity of the stone, which I told you was broke off the parapet,--as
by its size,--(tho' it was pretty large) which inclined the surgeon all
along to think, that the great injury which it had done my uncle Toby's
groin, was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself, than to the
projectile force of it,--which he would often tell him was a great
happiness.
My father at that time was just beginning business in London, and had taken
a house;--and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the
two brothers,--and that my father thought my uncle Toby could no where be
so well nursed and taken care of as in his own house,--he assign'd him the
very best apartment in it.--And what was a much more sincere mark of his
affection still, he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step
into the house on any occasion, but he would take him by the hand, and lead
him up stairs to see his brother Toby, and chat an hour by his bed-side.
The history of a soldier's wound beguiles the pain of it;--my uncle's
visitors at least thought so, and in their daily calls upon him, from the
courtesy arising out of that belief, they would frequently turn the
discourse to that subject,--and from that subject the discourse would
generally roll on to the siege itself.
These conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle Toby received great
relief from them, and would have received much more, but that they brought
him into some unforeseen perplexities, which, for three months together,
retarded his cure greatly; and if he had not hit upon an expedient to
extricate himself out of them, I verily believe they would have laid him in
his grave.
What these perplexities of my uncle Toby were,--'tis impossible for you to
guess;--if you could,--I should blush; not as a relation,--not as a man,--
nor even as a woman,--but I should blush as an author; inasmuch as I set no
small store by myself upon this very account, that my reader has never yet
been able to guess at any thing. And in this, Sir, I am of so nice and
singular a humour, that if I thought you was able to form the least
judgment or probable conjecture to yourself, of what was to come in the
next page,--I would tear it out of my book.
Chapter 1.XXVI.
I have begun a new book, on purpose that I might have room enough to
explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle Toby was involved,
from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of Namur, where
he received his wound.
I must remind the reader, in case he has read the history of King William's
wars,--but if he has not,--I then inform him, that one of the most
memorable attacks in that siege, was that which was made by the English and
Dutch upon the point of the advanced counterscarp, between the gate of St.
Nicolas, which inclosed the great sluice or water-stop, where the English
were terribly exposed to the shot of the counter-guard and demi-bastion of
St. Roch: The issue of which hot dispute, in three words, was this; That
the Dutch lodged themselves upon the counter-guard,--and that the English
made themselves masters of the covered-way before St. Nicolas-gate,
notwithstanding the gallantry of the French officers, who exposed
themselves upon the glacis sword in hand.
As this was the principal attack of which my uncle Toby was an eye-witness
at Namur,--the army of the besiegers being cut off, by the confluence of
the Maes and Sambre, from seeing much of each other's operations,--my uncle
Toby was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it; and
the many perplexities he was in, arose out of the almost insurmountable
difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly, and giving such
clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and
counterscarp,--the glacis and covered-way,--the half-moon and ravelin,--as
to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about.
Writers themselves are too apt to confound these terms; so that you will
the less wonder, if in his endeavours to explain them, and in opposition to
many misconceptions, that my uncle Toby did oft-times puzzle his visitors,
and sometimes himself too.
To speak the truth, unless the company my father led up stairs were
tolerably clear-headed, or my uncle Toby was in one of his explanatory
moods, 'twas a difficult thing, do what he could, to keep the discourse
free from obscurity.
What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle
Toby, was this,--that in the attack of the counterscarp, before the gate of
St. Nicolas, extending itself from the bank of the Maes, quite up to the
great water-stop,--the ground was cut and cross cut with such a multitude
of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,--and he would get so
sadly bewildered, and set fast amongst them, that frequently he could
neither get backwards or forwards to save his life; and was oft-times
obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only. 
These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle Toby Shandy more perturbations than
you would imagine; and as my father's kindness to him was continually
dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirers,--he had but a very uneasy
task of it. 
No doubt my uncle Toby had great command of himself,--and could guard
appearances, I believe, as well as most men;--yet any one may imagine, that
when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the half-
moon, or get out of the covered-way without falling down the counterscarp,
nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch, but that he
must have fretted and fumed inwardly:--He did so;--and the little and
hourly vexations, which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who
has not read Hippocrates, yet, whoever has read Hippocrates, or Dr. James
Mackenzie, and has considered well the effects which the passions and
affections of the mind have upon the digestion--(Why not of a wound as well
as of a dinner?)--may easily conceive what sharp paroxysms and
exacerbations of his wound my uncle Toby must have undergone upon that
score only.
--My uncle Toby could not philosophize upon it;--'twas enough he felt it
was so,--and having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months
together, he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself.
He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed, the anguish and nature
of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lie in no other position, when
a thought came into his head, that if he could purchase such a thing, and
have it pasted down upon a board, as a large map of the fortification of
the town and citadel of Namur, with its environs, it might be a means of
giving him ease.--I take notice of his desire to have the environs along
with the town and citadel, for this reason,--because my uncle Toby's wound
was got in one of the traverses, about thirty toises from the returning
angle of the trench, opposite to the salient angle of the demi-bastion of
St. Roch:--so that he was pretty confident he could stick a pin upon the
identical spot of ground where he was standing on when the stone struck
him.
All this succeeded to his wishes, and not only freed him from a world of
sad explanations, but, in the end, it proved the happy means, as you will
read, of procuring my uncle Toby his Hobby-Horse.
Chapter 1.XXVII.
There is nothing so foolish, when you are at the expence of making an
entertainment of this kind, as to order things so badly, as to let your
criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down: Nor is there any thing
so likely to make them do it, as that of leaving them out of the party, or,
what is full as offensive, of bestowing your attention upon the rest of
your guests in so particular a way, as if there was no such thing as a
critick (by occupation) at table.
--I guard against both; for, in the first place, I have left half a dozen
places purposely open for them;--and in the next place, I pay them all
court.--Gentlemen, I kiss your hands, I protest no company could give me
half the pleasure,--by my soul I am glad to see you--I beg only you will
make no strangers of yourselves, but sit down without any ceremony, and
fall on heartily.
I said I had left six places, and I was upon the point of carrying my
complaisance so far, as to have left a seventh open for them,--and in this
very spot I stand on; but being told by a Critick (tho' not by occupation,-
-but by nature) that I had acquitted myself well enough, I shall fill it up
directly, hoping, in the mean time, that I shall be able to make a great
deal of more room next year. 
--How, in the name of wonder! could your uncle Toby, who, it seems, was a
military man, and whom you have represented as no fool,--be at the same
time such a confused, pudding-headed, muddle-headed, fellow, as--Go look.
So, Sir Critick, I could have replied; but I scorn it.--'Tis language
unurbane,--and only befitting the man who cannot give clear and
satisfactory accounts of things, or dive deep enough into the first causes
of human ignorance and confusion. It is moreover the reply valiant--and
therefore I reject it; for tho' it might have suited my uncle Toby's
character as a soldier excellently well,--and had he not accustomed
himself, in such attacks, to whistle the Lillabullero, as he wanted no
courage, 'tis the very answer he would have given; yet it would by no means
have done for me. You see as plain as can be, that I write as a man of
erudition;--that even my similies, my allusions, my illustrations, my
metaphors, are erudite,--and that I must sustain my character properly, and
contrast it properly too,--else what would become of me? Why, Sir, I
should be undone;--at this very moment that I am going here to fill up one
place against a critick,--I should have made an opening for a couple.
--Therefore I answer thus:
Pray, Sir, in all the reading which you have ever read, did you ever read
such a book as Locke's Essay upon the Human Understanding?--Don't answer me
rashly--because many, I know, quote the book, who have not read it--and
many have read it who understand it not:--If either of these is your case,
as I write to instruct, I will tell you in three words what the book is.--
It is a history.--A history! of who? what? where? when? Don't hurry
yourself--It is a history-book, Sir, (which may possibly recommend it to
the world) of what passes in a man's own mind; and if you will say so much
of the book, and no more, believe me, you will cut no contemptible figure
in a metaphysick circle.
But this by the way.
Now if you will venture to go along with me, and look down into the bottom
of this matter, it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion,
in the mind of a man, is threefold.
Dull organs, dear Sir, in the first place. Secondly, slight and transient
impressions made by the objects, when the said organs are not dull. And
thirdly, a memory like unto a sieve, not able to retain what it has
received.--Call down Dolly your chamber-maid, and I will give you my cap
and bell along with it, if I make not this matter so plain that Dolly
herself should understand it as well as Malbranch.--When Dolly has indited
her epistle to Robin, and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket
hanging by her right side;--take that opportunity to recollect that the
organs and faculties of perception can, by nothing in this world, be so
aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which Dolly's hand is in
search of.--Your organs are not so dull that I should inform you--'tis an
inch, Sir, of red seal-wax.
When this is melted and dropped upon the letter, if Dolly fumbles too long
for her thimble, till the wax is over hardened, it will not receive the
mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it. 
Very well. If Dolly's wax, for want of better, is bees-wax, or of a temper
too soft,--tho' it may receive,--it will not hold the impression, how hard
soever Dolly thrusts against it; and last of all, supposing the wax good,
and eke the thimble, but applied thereto in careless haste, as her Mistress
rings the bell;--in any one of these three cases the print left by the
thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brass-jack.
Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the
confusion in my uncle Toby's discourse; and it is for that very reason I
enlarge upon them so long, after the manner of great physiologists--to shew
the world, what it did not arise from.
What it did arise from, I have hinted above, and a fertile source of
obscurity it is,--and ever will be,--and that is the unsteady uses of
words, which have perplexed the clearest and most exalted understandings.
It is ten to one (at Arthur's) whether you have ever read the literary
histories of past ages;--if you have, what terrible battles, 'yclept
logomachies, have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and
ink-shed,--that a good-natured man cannot read the accounts of them without
tears in his eyes.
Gentle critick! when thou hast weighed all this, and considered within
thyself how much of thy own knowledge, discourse, and conversation has been
pestered and disordered, at one time or other, by this, and this only:--
What a pudder and racket in Councils about (Greek); and in the Schools of
the learned about power and about spirit;--about essences, and about
quintessences;--about substances, and about space.--What confusion in
greater Theatres from words of little meaning, and as indeterminate a
sense! when thou considerest this, thou wilt not wonder at my uncle Toby's
perplexities,--thou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his
counterscarp;--his glacis and his covered way;--his ravelin and his half-
moon: 'Twas not by ideas,--by Heaven; his life was put in jeopardy by
words.
Chapter 1.XXVIII.
When my uncle Toby got his map of Namur to his mind, he began immediately
to apply himself, and with the utmost diligence, to the study of it; for
nothing being of more importance to him than his recovery, and his recovery
depending, as you have read, upon the passions and affections of his mind,
it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his
subject, as to be able to talk upon it without emotion.
In a fortnight's close and painful application, which, by the bye, did my
uncle Toby's wound, upon his groin, no good,--he was enabled, by the help
of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant, together with
Gobesius's military architecture and pyroballogy, translated from the
Flemish, to form his discourse with passable perspicuity; and before he was
two full months gone,--he was right eloquent upon it, and could make not
only the attack of the advanced counterscarp with great order;--but having,
by that time, gone much deeper into the art, than what his first motive
made necessary, my uncle Toby was able to cross the Maes and Sambre; make
diversions as far as Vauban's line, the abbey of Salsines, &c. and give his
visitors as distinct a history of each of their attacks, as of that of the
gate of St. Nicolas, where he had the honour to receive his wound.
But desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the
acquisition of it. The more my uncle Toby pored over his map, the more he
took a liking to it!--by the same process and electrical assimilation, as I
told you, through which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves, by
long friction and incumbition, have the happiness, at length, to get all
be-virtu'd--be-pictured,--be-butterflied, and be-fiddled.
The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science, the greater
was the heat and impatience of his thirst, so that before the first year of
his confinement had well gone round, there was scarce a fortified town in
Italy or Flanders, of which, by one means or other, he had not procured a
plan, reading over as he got them, and carefully collating therewith the
histories of their sieges, their demolitions, their improvements, and new
works, all which he would read with that intense application and delight,
that he would forget himself, his wound, his confinement, his dinner.
In the second year my uncle Toby purchased Ramelli and Cataneo, translated
from the Italian;--likewise Stevinus, Moralis, the Chevalier de Ville,
Lorini, Cochorn, Sheeter, the Count de Pagan, the Marshal Vauban, Mons.
Blondel, with almost as many more books of military architecture, as Don
Quixote was found to have of chivalry, when the curate and barber invaded
his library.
Towards the beginning of the third year, which was in August, ninety-nine,
my uncle Toby found it necessary to understand a little of projectiles:--
and having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the fountain-head, he
began with N. Tartaglia, who it seems was the first man who detected the
imposition of a cannon-ball's doing all that mischief under the notion of a
right line--This N. Tartaglia proved to my uncle Toby to be an impossible
thing.
--Endless is the search of Truth.
No sooner was my uncle Toby satisfied which road the cannon-ball did not
go, but he was insensibly led on, and resolved in his mind to enquire and
find out which road the ball did go: For which purpose he was obliged to
set off afresh with old Maltus, and studied him devoutly.--He proceeded
next to Galileo and Torricellius, wherein, by certain Geometrical rules,
infallibly laid down, he found the precise path to be a Parabola--or else
an Hyperbola,--and that the parameter, or latus rectum, of the conic
section of the said path, was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct
ratio, as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence,
formed by the breech upon an horizontal plane;--and that the
semiparameter,--stop! my dear uncle Toby--stop!--go not one foot farther
into this thorny and bewildered track,--intricate are the steps! intricate
are the mazes of this labyrinth! intricate are the troubles which the
pursuit of this bewitching phantom Knowledge will bring upon thee.--O my
uncle;--fly--fly,--fly from it as from a serpent.--Is it fit--goodnatured
man! thou should'st sit up, with the wound upon thy groin, whole nights
baking thy blood with hectic watchings?--Alas! 'twill exasperate thy
symptoms,--check thy perspirations--evaporate thy spirits--waste thy animal
strength, dry up thy radical moisture, bring thee into a costive habit of
body,--impair thy health,--and hasten all the infirmities of thy old age.--
O my uncle! my uncle Toby.
Chapter 1.XXIX.
I would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pen-craft, who does
not understand this,--That the best plain narrative in the world, tacked
very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle Toby--would have
felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palate;--therefore I forthwith
put an end to the chapter, though I was in the middle of my story.
--Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with painters. Where an
exact copying makes our pictures less striking, we choose the less evil;
deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth, than beauty. 
This is to be understood cum grano salis; but be it as it will,--as the
parallel is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool, than any
thing else,--'tis not very material whether upon any other score the reader
approves of it or not.
In the latter end of the third year, my uncle Toby perceiving that the
parameter and semi-parameter of the conic section angered his wound, he
left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff, and betook himself
to the practical part of fortification only; the pleasure of which, like a
spring held back, returned upon him with redoubled force.
It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily
regularity of a clean shirt,--to dismiss his barber unshaven,--and to allow
his surgeon scarce time sufficient to dress his wound, concerning himself
so little about it, as not to ask him once in seven times dressing, how it
went on: when, lo!--all of a sudden, for the change was quick as
lightning, he began to sigh heavily for his recovery,--complained to my
father, grew impatient with the surgeon:--and one morning, as he heard his
foot coming up stairs, he shut up his books, and thrust aside his
instruments, in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction of the
cure, which, he told him, might surely have been accomplished at least by
that time:--He dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone, and the
sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonment;--adding, that had it not
been for the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothers,--
he had long since sunk under his misfortunes.--My father was by. My uncle
Toby's eloquence brought tears into his eyes;--'twas unexpected:--My uncle
Toby, by nature was not eloquent;--it had the greater effect:--The surgeon
was confounded;--not that there wanted grounds for such, or greater marks
of impatience,--but 'twas unexpected too; in the four years he had attended
him, he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle Toby's carriage; he
had never once dropped one fretful or discontented word;--he had been all
patience,--all submission.
--We lose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing it;--but we
often treble the force:--The surgeon was astonished; but much more so, when
he heard my uncle Toby go on, and peremptorily insist upon his healing up
the wound directly,--or sending for Monsieur Ronjat, the king's serjeant-
surgeon, to do it for him.
The desire of life and health is implanted in man's nature;--the love of
liberty and enlargement is a sister-passion to it: These my uncle Toby had
in common with his species--and either of them had been sufficient to
account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doors;--but I have
told you before, that nothing wrought with our family after the common
way;--and from the time and manner in which this eager desire shewed itself
in the present case, the penetrating reader will suspect there was some
other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle Toby's head:--There was so, and
'tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and
crotchet was. I own, when that's done, 'twill be time to return back to
the parlour fire-side, where we left my uncle Toby in the middle of his
sentence.
Chapter 1.XXX.
When a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passion,--or, in
other words, when his Hobby-Horse grows headstrong,--farewell cool reason
and fair discretion!
My uncle Toby's wound was near well, and as soon as the surgeon recovered
his surprize, and could get leave to say as much--he told him, 'twas just
beginning to incarnate; and that if no fresh exfoliation happened, which
there was no sign of,--it would be dried up in five or six weeks. The
sound of as many Olympiads, twelve hours before, would have conveyed an
idea of shorter duration to my uncle Toby's mind.--The succession of his
ideas was now rapid,--he broiled with impatience to put his design in
execution;--and so, without consulting farther with any soul living,--
which, by the bye, I think is right, when you are predetermined to take no
one soul's advice,--he privately ordered Trim, his man, to pack up a bundle
of lint and dressings, and hire a chariot-and-four to be at the door
exactly by twelve o'clock that day, when he knew my father would be upon
'Change.--So leaving a bank-note upon the table for the surgeon's care of
him, and a letter of tender thanks for his brother's--he packed up his
maps, his books of fortification, his instruments, &c. and by the help of a
crutch on one side, and Trim on the other,--my uncle Toby embarked for
Shandy-Hall.
The reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as follows:
The table in my uncle Toby's room, and at which, the night before this
change happened, he was sitting with his maps, &c. about him--being
somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity of great and small instruments
of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it--he had the accident, in
reaching over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his compasses, and in
stooping to take the compasses up, with his sleeve he threw down his case
of instruments and snuffers;--and as the dice took a run against him, in
his endeavouring to catch the snuffers in falling,--he thrust Monsieur
Blondel off the table, and Count de Pagon o'top of him.
'Twas to no purpose for a man, lame as my uncle Toby was, to think of
redressing these evils by himself,--he rung his bell for his man Trim;--
Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, prithee see what confusion I have here been
making--I must have some better contrivance, Trim.--Can'st not thou take my
rule, and measure the length and breadth of this table, and then go and
bespeak me one as big again?--Yes, an' please your Honour, replied Trim,
making a bow; but I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down
to your country-seat, where,--as your Honour takes so much pleasure in
fortification, we could manage this matter to a T.
I must here inform you, that this servant of my uncle Toby's, who went by
the name of Trim, had been a corporal in my uncle's own company,--his real
name was James Butler,--but having got the nick-name of Trim, in the
regiment, my uncle Toby, unless when he happened to be very angry with him,
would never call him by any other name.
The poor fellow had been disabled for the service, by a wound on his left
knee by a musket-bullet, at the battle of Landen, which was two years
before the affair of Namur;--and as the fellow was well-beloved in the
regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle Toby took him for
his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending my uncle Toby in the
camp and in his quarters as a valet, groom, barber, cook, sempster, and
nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and served him with
great fidelity and affection.
My uncle Toby loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him
still, was the similitude of their knowledge.--For Corporal Trim, (for so,
for the future, I shall call him) by four years occasional attention to his
Master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of prying and
peeping continually into his Master's plans, &c. exclusive and besides what
he gained Hobby-Horsically, as a body-servant, Non Hobby Horsical per se;--
had become no mean proficient in the science; and was thought, by the cook
and chamber-maid, to know as much of the nature of strong-holds as my uncle
Toby himself.
I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal Trim's character,--
and it is the only dark line in it.--The fellow loved to advise,--or rather
to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so perfectly respectful,
'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so; but set his tongue a-
going,--you had no hold of him--he was voluble;--the eternal interlardings
of your Honour, with the respectfulness of Corporal Trim's manner,
interceding so strong in behalf of his elocution,--that though you might
have been incommoded,--you could not well be angry. My uncle Toby was
seldom either the one or the other with him,--or, at least, this fault, in
Trim, broke no squares with them. My uncle Toby, as I said, loved the
man;--and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant,--but as an
humble friend,--he could not bear to stop his mouth.--Such was Corporal
Trim.
If I durst presume, continued Trim, to give your Honour my advice, and
speak my opinion in this matter.--Thou art welcome, Trim, quoth my uncle
Toby--speak,--speak what thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without
fear.--Why then, replied Trim, (not hanging his ears and scratching his
head like a country-lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead,
and standing erect as before his division,--I think, quoth Trim, advancing
his left, which was his lame leg, a little forwards,--and pointing with his
right hand open towards a map of Dunkirk, which was pinned against the
hangings,--I think, quoth Corporal Trim, with humble submission to your
Honour's better judgment,--that these ravelins, bastions, curtins, and
hornworks, make but a poor, contemptible, fiddle-faddle piece of work of it
here upon paper, compared to what your Honour and I could make of it were
we in the country by ourselves, and had but a rood, or a rood and a half of
ground to do what we pleased with: As summer is coming on, continued Trim,
your Honour might sit out of doors, and give me the nography--(Call it
ichnography, quoth my uncle,)--of the town or citadel, your Honour was
pleased to sit down before,--and I will be shot by your Honour upon the
glacis of it, if I did not fortify it to your Honour's mind.--I dare say
thou would'st, Trim, quoth my uncle.--For if your Honour, continued the
Corporal, could but mark me the polygon, with its exact lines and angles--
That I could do very well, quoth my uncle.--I would begin with the fosse,
and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadth--I can to a
hair's breadth, Trim, replied my uncle.--I would throw out the earth upon
this hand towards the town for the scarp,--and on that hand towards the
campaign for the counterscarp.--Very right, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby:--And
when I had sloped them to your mind,--an' please your Honour, I would face
the glacis, as the finest fortifications are done in Flanders, with sods,--
and as your Honour knows they should be,--and I would make the walls and
parapets with sods too.--The best engineers call them gazons, Trim, said my
uncle Toby.--Whether they are gazons or sods, is not much matter, replied
Trim; your Honour knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick
or stone.--I know they are, Trim in some respects,--quoth my uncle Toby,
nodding his head;--for a cannon-ball enters into the gazon right onwards,
without bringing any rubbish down with it, which might fill the fosse, (as
was the case at St. Nicolas's gate) and facilitate the passage over it.
Your Honour understands these matters, replied Corporal Trim, better than
any officer in his Majesty's service;--but would your Honour please to let
the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the country, I
would work under your Honour's directions like a horse, and make
fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their batteries,
saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all the world's
riding twenty miles to go and see it.
My uncle Toby blushed as red as scarlet as Trim went on;--but it was not a
blush of guilt,--of modesty,--or of anger,--it was a blush of joy;--he was
fired with Corporal Trim's project and description.--Trim! said my uncle
Toby, thou hast said enough.--We might begin the campaign, continued Trim,
on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the field, and
demolish them town by town as fast as--Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, say no
more. Your Honour, continued Trim, might sit in your arm-chair (pointing
to it) this fine weather, giving me your orders, and I would--Say no more,
Trim, quoth my uncle Toby--Besides, your Honour would get not only pleasure
and good pastime--but good air, and good exercise, and good health,--and
your Honour's wound would be well in a month. Thou hast said enough,
Trim,--quoth my uncle Toby (putting his hand into his breeches-pocket)--I
like thy project mightily.--And if your Honour pleases, I'll this moment go
and buy a pioneer's spade to take down with us, and I'll bespeak a shovel
and a pick-axe, and a couple of--Say no more, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,
leaping up upon one leg, quite overcome with rapture,--and thrusting a
guinea into Trim's hand,--Trim, said my uncle Toby, say no more;--but go
down, Trim, this moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this instant.
Trim ran down and brought up his master's supper,--to no purpose:--Trim's
plan of operation ran so in my uncle Toby's head, he could not taste it.--
Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, get me to bed.--'Twas all one.--Corporal Trim's
description had fired his imagination,--my uncle Toby could not shut his
eyes.--The more he considered it, the more bewitching the scene appeared to
him;--so that, two full hours before day-light, he had come to a final
determination and had concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal Trim's
decampment.
My uncle Toby had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village
where my father's estate lay at Shandy, which had been left him by an old
uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a-year. Behind this
house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about half an acre,
and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge,
was a bowling-green, containing just about as much ground as Corporal Trim
wished for;--so that as Trim uttered the words, 'A rood and a half of
ground to do what they would with,'--this identical bowling-green instantly
presented itself, and became curiously painted all at once, upon the retina
of my uncle Toby's fancy;--which was the physical cause of making him
change colour, or at least of heightening his blush, to that immoderate
degree I spoke of.
Never did lover post down to a beloved mistress with more heat and
expectation, than my uncle Toby did, to enjoy this self-same thing in
private;--I say in private;--for it was sheltered from the house, as I told
you, by a tall yew hedge, and was covered on the other three sides, from
mortal sight, by rough holly and thick-set flowering shrubs:--so that the
idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure
pre-conceived in my uncle Toby's mind.--Vain thought! however thick it was
planted about,--or private soever it might seem,--to think, dear uncle
Toby, of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of ground,-
-and not have it known!
How my uncle Toby and Corporal Trim managed this matter,--with the history
of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,--may make no
uninteresting under-plot in the epitasis and working-up of this drama.--At
present the scene must drop,--and change for the parlour fire-side.
Chapter 1.XXXI.
--What can they be doing? brother, said my father.--I think, replied my
uncle Toby,--taking, as I told you, his pipe from his mouth, and striking
the ashes out of it as he began his sentence;--I think, replied he,--it
would not be amiss, brother, if we rung the bell.
Pray, what's all that racket over our heads, Obadiah?--quoth my father;--my
brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak.
Sir, answered Obadiah, making a bow towards his left shoulder,--my Mistress
is taken very badly.--And where's Susannah running down the garden there,
as if they were going to ravish her?--Sir, she is running the shortest cut
into the town, replied Obadiah, to fetch the old midwife.--Then saddle a
horse, quoth my father, and do you go directly for Dr. Slop, the man-
midwife, with all our services,--and let him know your mistress is fallen
into labour--and that I desire he will return with you with all speed.
It is very strange, says my father, addressing himself to my uncle Toby, as
Obadiah shut the door,--as there is so expert an operator as Dr. Slop so
near,--that my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate
humour of hers, in trusting the life of my child, who has had one
misfortune already, to the ignorance of an old woman;--and not only the
life of my child, brother,--but her own life, and with it the lives of all
the children I might, peradventure, have begot out of her hereafter.
Mayhap, brother, replied my uncle Toby, my sister does it to save the
expence:--A pudding's end,--replied my father,--the Doctor must be paid the
same for inaction as action,--if not better,--to keep him in temper.
--Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world, quoth my uncle Toby, in
the simplicity of his heart,--but Modesty.--My sister, I dare say, added
he, does not care to let a man come so near her. . .. I will not say
whether my uncle Toby had completed the sentence or not;--'tis for his
advantage to suppose he had,--as, I think, he could have added no One Word
which would have improved it.
If, on the contrary, my uncle Toby had not fully arrived at the period's
end--then the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my father's
tobacco-pipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in
oratory, which Rhetoricians stile the Aposiopesis.--Just Heaven! how does
the Poco piu and the Poco meno of the Italian artists;--the insensible more
or less, determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence, as well as
in the statue! How do the slight touches of the chisel, the pencil, the
pen, the fiddle-stick, et caetera,--give the true swell, which gives the
true pleasure!--O my countrymen:--be nice; be cautious of your language;
and never, O! never let it be forgotten upon what small particles your
eloquence and your fame depend.
--'My sister, mayhap,' quoth my uncle Toby, 'does not choose to let a man
come so near her. . ..' Make this dash,--'tis an Aposiopesis,--Take the
dash away, and write Backside,--'tis Bawdy.--Scratch Backside out, and put
Cover'd way in, 'tis a Metaphor;--and, I dare say, as fortification ran so
much in my uncle Toby's head, that if he had been left to have added one
word to the sentence,--that word was it.
But whether that was the case or not the case;--or whether the snapping of
my father's tobacco-pipe, so critically, happened through accident or
anger, will be seen in due time.
Chapter 1.XXXII.
Tho' my father was a good natural philosopher,--yet he was something of a
moral philosopher too; for which reason, when his tobacco-pipe snapp'd
short in the middle,--he had nothing to do, as such, but to have taken hold
of the two pieces, and thrown them gently upon the back of the fire.--He
did no such thing;--he threw them with all the violence in the world;--and,
to give the action still more emphasis,--he started upon both his legs to
do it.
This looked something like heat;--and the manner of his reply to what my
uncle Toby was saying, proved it was so.
--'Not choose,' quoth my father, (repeating my uncle Toby's words) 'to let
a man come so near her!'--By Heaven, brother Toby! you would try the
patience of Job;--and I think I have the plagues of one already without
it.--Why?--Where?--Wherein?--Wherefore?--Upon what account? replied my
uncle Toby: in the utmost astonishment.--To think, said my father, of a man
living to your age, brother, and knowing so little about women!--I know
nothing at all about them,--replied my uncle Toby: And I think, continued
he, that the shock I received the year after the demolition of Dunkirk, in
my affair with widow Wadman;--which shock you know I should not have
received, but from my total ignorance of the sex,--has given me just cause
to say, That I neither know nor do pretend to know any thing about 'em or
their concerns either.--Methinks, brother, replied my father, you might, at
least, know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong.
It is said in Aristotle's Master Piece, 'That when a man doth think of any
thing which is past,--he looketh down upon the ground;--but that when he
thinketh of something that is to come, he looketh up towards the heavens.'
My uncle Toby, I suppose, thought of neither, for he look'd horizontally.--
Right end! quoth my uncle Toby, muttering the two words low to himself, and
fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them, upon a small crevice,
formed by a bad joint in the chimney-piece--Right end of a woman!--I
declare, quoth my uncle, I know no more which it is than the man in the
moon;--and if I was to think, continued my uncle Toby (keeping his eyes
still fixed upon the bad joint) this month together, I am sure I should not
be able to find it out.
Then, brother Toby, replied my father, I will tell you.
Every thing in this world, continued my father (filling a fresh pipe)--
every thing in this world, my dear brother Toby, has two handles.--Not
always, quoth my uncle Toby.--At least, replied my father, every one has
two hands,--which comes to the same thing.--Now, if a man was to sit down
coolly, and consider within himself the make, the shape, the construction,
come-at-ability, and convenience of all the parts which constitute the
whole of that animal, called Woman, and compare them analogically--I never
understood rightly the meaning of that word,--quoth my uncle Toby.--
Analogy, replied my father, is the certain relation and agreement which
different--Here a devil of a rap at the door snapped my father's definition
(like his tobacco-pipe) in two,--and, at the same time, crushed the head of
as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was engendered in the womb of
speculation;--it was some months before my father could get an opportunity
to be safely delivered of it:--And, at this hour, it is a thing full as
problematical as the subject of the dissertation itself,--(considering the
confusion and distresses of our domestick misadventures, which are now
coming thick one upon the back of another) whether I shall be able to find
a place for it in the third volume or not.
Chapter 1.XXXIII.
It is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle Toby
rung the bell, when Obadiah was ordered to saddle a horse, and go for Dr.
Slop, the man-midwife;--so that no one can say, with reason, that I have
not allowed Obadiah time enough, poetically speaking, and considering the
emergency too, both to go and come;--though, morally and truly speaking,
the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots.
If the hypercritick will go upon this; and is resolved after all to take a
pendulum, and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell,
and the rap at the door;--and, after finding it to be no more than two
minutes, thirteen seconds, and three-fifths,--should take upon him to
insult over me for such a breach in the unity, or rather probability of
time;--I would remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its simple
modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our ideas--and is the
true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar, I will be tried in
this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other
pendulums whatever.
I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from Shandy-Hall to Dr. Slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst
Obadiah has been going those said miles and back, I have brought my uncle
Toby from Namur, quite across all Flanders, into England:--That I have had
him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since travelled him and
Corporal Trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near two hundred miles
down into Yorkshire.--all which put together, must have prepared the
reader's imagination for the entrance of Dr. Slop upon the stage,--as much,
at least (I hope) as a dance, a song, or a concerto between the acts.
If my hypercritick is intractable, alledging, that two minutes and thirteen
seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen seconds,--when I have
said all I can about them; and that this plea, though it might save me
dramatically, will damn me biographically, rendering my book from this very
moment, a professed Romance, which, before, was a book apocryphal:--If I am
thus pressed--I then put an end to the whole objection and controversy
about it all at once,--by acquainting him, that Obadiah had not got above
threescore yards from the stable-yard, before he met with Dr. Slop;--and
indeed he gave a dirty proof that he had met with him, and was within an
ace of giving a tragical one too.
Imagine to yourself;--but this had better begin a new chapter.
Chapter 1.XXXIV.
Imagine to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure of a Doctor Slop, of
about four feet and a half perpendicular height, with a breadth of back,
and a sesquipedality of belly, which might have done honour to a serjeant
in the horse-guards.
Such were the out-lines of Dr. Slop's figure, which--if you have read
Hogarth's analysis of beauty, and if you have not, I wish you would;--you
must know, may as certainly be caricatured, and conveyed to the mind by
three strokes as three hundred.
Imagine such a one,--for such, I say, were the outlines of Dr. Slop's
figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling thro' the dirt upon the
vertebrae of a little diminutive pony, of a pretty colour--but of
strength,--alack!--scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such a
fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition.--They were not.--
Imagine to yourself, Obadiah mounted upon a strong monster of a coach-
horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making all practicable speed the
adverse way.
Pray, Sir, let me interest you a moment in this description.
Had Dr. Slop beheld Obadiah a mile off, posting in a narrow lane directly
towards him, at that monstrous rate,--splashing and plunging like a devil
thro' thick and thin, as he approached, would not such a phaenomenon, with
such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it, round its axis,--have
been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr. Slop in his situation, than
the worst of Whiston's comets?--To say nothing of the Nucleus; that is, of
Obadiah and the coach-horse.--In my idea, the vortex alone of 'em was
enough to have involved and carried, if not the doctor, at least the
doctor's pony, quite away with it. What then do you think must the terror
and hydrophobia of Dr. Slop have been, when you read (which you are just
going to do) that he was advancing thus warily along towards Shandy-Hall,
and had approached to within sixty yards of it, and within five yards of a
sudden turn, made by an acute angle of the garden-wall,--and in the
dirtiest part of a dirty lane,--when Obadiah and his coach-horse turned the
corner, rapid, furious,--pop,--full upon him!--Nothing, I think, in nature,
can be supposed more terrible than such a rencounter,--so imprompt! so ill
prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr. Slop was.
What could Dr. Slop do?--he crossed himself + --Pugh!--but the doctor, Sir,
was a Papist.--No matter; he had better have kept hold of the pummel.--He
had so;--nay, as it happened, he had better have done nothing at all; for
in crossing himself he let go his whip,--and in attempting to save his whip
betwixt his knee and his saddle's skirt, as it slipped, he lost his
stirrup,--in losing which he lost his seat;--and in the multitude of all
these losses (which, by the bye, shews what little advantage there is in
crossing) the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind. So that
without waiting for Obadiah's onset, he left his pony to its destiny,
tumbling off it diagonally, something in the stile and manner of a pack of
wool, and without any other consequence from the fall, save that of being
left (as it would have been) with the broadest part of him sunk about
twelve inches deep in the mire.
Obadiah pull'd off his cap twice to Dr. Slop;--once as he was falling,--and
then again when he saw him seated.--Ill-timed complaisance;--had not the
fellow better have stopped his horse, and got off and help'd him?--Sir, he
did all that his situation would allow;--but the Momentum of the coach-
horse was so great, that Obadiah could not do it all at once; he rode in a
circle three times round Dr. Slop, before he could fully accomplish it any
how;--and at the last, when he did stop his beast, 'twas done with such an
explosion of mud, that Obadiah had better have been a league off. In
short, never was a Dr. Slop so beluted, and so transubstantiated, since
that affair came into fashion.
Chapter 1.XXXV.
When Dr. Slop entered the back parlour, where my father and my uncle Toby
were discoursing upon the nature of women,--it was hard to determine
whether Dr. Slop's figure, or Dr. Slop's presence, occasioned more surprize
to them; for as the accident happened so near the house, as not to make it
worth while for Obadiah to remount him,--Obadiah had led him in as he was,
unwiped, unappointed, unannealed, with all his stains and blotches on him.-
-He stood like Hamlet's ghost, motionless and speechless, for a full minute
and a half at the parlour-door (Obadiah still holding his hand) with all
the majesty of mud. His hinder parts, upon which he had received his fall,
totally besmeared,--and in every other part of him, blotched over in such a
manner with Obadiah's explosion, that you would have sworn (without mental
reservation) that every grain of it had taken effect.
Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle Toby to have triumphed over my
father in his turn;--for no mortal, who had beheld Dr. Slop in that pickle,
could have dissented from so much, at least, of my uncle Toby's opinion,
'That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a Dr. Slop come so near
her. . ..' But it was the Argumentum ad hominem; and if my uncle Toby was
not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care to use it.--No; the
reason was,--'twas not his nature to insult.
Dr. Slop's presence at that time, was no less problematical than the mode
of it; tho' it is certain, one moment's reflexion in my father might have
solved it; for he had apprized Dr. Slop but the week before, that my mother
was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard nothing since, 'twas
natural and very political too in him, to have taken a ride to Shandy-Hall,
as he did, merely to see how matters went on.
But my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation;
running, like the hypercritick's, altogether upon the ringing of the bell
and the rap upon the door,--measuring their distance, and keeping his mind
so intent upon the operation, as to have power to think of nothing else,--
common-place infirmity of the greatest mathematicians! working with might
and main at the demonstration, and so wasting all their strength upon it,
that they have none left in them to draw the corollary, to do good with.
The ringing of the bell, and the rap upon the door, struck likewise strong
upon the sensorium of my uncle Toby,--but it excited a very different train
of thoughts;--the two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought
Stevinus, the great engineer, along with them, into my uncle Toby's mind. 
What business Stevinus had in this affair,--is the greatest problem of
all:--It shall be solved,--but not in the next chapter.
Chapter 1.XXXVI.
Writing, when properly managed (as you may be sure I think mine is) is but
a different name for conversation. As no one, who knows what he is about
in good company, would venture to talk all;--so no author, who understands
the just boundaries of decorum and good-breeding, would presume to think
all: The truest respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding,
is to halve this matter amicably, and leave him something to imagine, in
his turn, as well as yourself.
For my own part, I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind, and do
all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own.
'Tis his turn now;--I have given an ample description of Dr. Slop's sad
overthrow, and of his sad appearance in the back-parlour;--his imagination
must now go on with it for a while.
Let the reader imagine then, that Dr. Slop has told his tale--and in what
words, and with what aggravations, his fancy chooses;--Let him suppose,
that Obadiah has told his tale also, and with such rueful looks of affected
concern, as he thinks best will contrast the two figures as they stand by
each other.--Let him imagine, that my father has stepped up stairs to see
my mother.--And, to conclude this work of imagination,--let him imagine the
doctor washed,--rubbed down, and condoled,--felicitated,--got into a pair
of Obadiah's pumps, stepping forwards towards the door, upon the very point
of entering upon action.
Truce!--truce, good Dr. Slop!--stay thy obstetrick hand;--return it safe
into thy bosom to keep it warm;--little dost thou know what obstacles,--
little dost thou think what hidden causes, retard its operation!--Hast
thou, Dr. Slop,--hast thou been entrusted with the secret articles of the
solemn treaty which has brought thee into this place?--Art thou aware that
at this instant, a daughter of Lucina is put obstetrically over thy head? 
Alas!--'tis too true.--Besides, great son of Pilumnus! what canst thou do?-
-Thou hast come forth unarm'd;--thou hast left thy tire-tete,--thy new-
invented forceps,--thy crotchet,--thy squirt, and all thy instruments of
salvation and deliverance, behind thee,--By Heaven! at this moment they are
hanging up in a green bays bag, betwixt thy two pistols, at the bed's
head!--Ring;--call;--send Obadiah back upon the coach-horse to bring them
with all speed. 
--Make great haste, Obadiah, quoth my father, and I'll give thee a crown!
and quoth my uncle Toby, I'll give him another.
Chapter 1.XXXVII.
Your sudden and unexpected arrival, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself
to Dr. Slop, (all three of them sitting down to the fire together, as my
uncle Toby began to speak)--instantly brought the great Stevinus into my
head, who, you must know, is a favourite author with me.--Then, added my
father, making use of the argument Ad Crumenam,--I will lay twenty guineas
to a single crown-piece (which will serve to give away to Obadiah when he
gets back) that this same Stevinus was some engineer or other--or has wrote
something or other, either directly or indirectly, upon the science of
fortification.
He has so,--replied my uncle Toby.--I knew it, said my father, though, for
the soul of me, I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt
Dr. Slop's sudden coming, and a discourse upon fortification;--yet I fear'd
it.--Talk of what we will, brother,--or let the occasion be never so
foreign or unfit for the subject,--you are sure to bring it in. I would
not, brother Toby, continued my father,--I declare I would not have my head
so full of curtins and horn-works.--That I dare say you would not, quoth
Dr. Slop, interrupting him, and laughing most immoderately at his pun.
Dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation of a
pun, more cordially than my father;--he would grow testy upon it at any
time;--but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was as bad,
he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;--he saw no difference.
Sir, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Dr. Slop,--the curtins my
brother Shandy mentions here, have nothing to do with beadsteads;--tho', I
know Du Cange says, 'That bed-curtains, in all probability, have taken
their name from them;'--nor have the horn-works he speaks of, any thing in
the world to do with the horn-works of cuckoldom: But the Curtin, Sir, is
the word we use in fortification, for that part of the wall or rampart
which lies between the two bastions and joins them--Besiegers seldom offer
to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin, for this reason,
because they are so well flanked. ('Tis the case of other curtains, quoth
Dr. Slop, laughing.) However, continued my uncle Toby, to make them sure,
we generally choose to place ravelins before them, taking care only to
extend them beyond the fosse or ditch:--The common men, who know very
little of fortification, confound the ravelin and the half-moon together,--
tho' they are very different things;--not in their figure or construction,
for we make them exactly alike, in all points; for they always consist of
two faces, making a salient angle, with the gorges, not straight, but in
form of a crescent;--Where then lies the difference? (quoth my father, a
little testily.)--In their situations, answered my uncle Toby:--For when a
ravelin, brother, stands before the curtin, it is a ravelin; and when a
ravelin stands before a bastion, then the ravelin is not a ravelin;--it is
a half-moon;--a half-moon likewise is a half-moon, and no more, so long as
it stands before its bastion;--but was it to change place, and get before
the curtin,--'twould be no longer a half-moon; a half-moon, in that case,
is not a half-moon;--'tis no more than a ravelin.--I think, quoth my
father, that the noble science of defence has its weak sides--as well as
others. 
As for the horn-work (high! ho! sigh'd my father) which, continued my uncle
Toby, my brother was speaking of, they are a very considerable part of an
outwork;--they are called by the French engineers, Ouvrage a corne, and we
generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than
the rest;--'tis formed by two epaulments or demi-bastions--they are very
pretty,--and if you will take a walk, I'll engage to shew you one well
worth your trouble.--I own, continued my uncle Toby, when we crown them,--
they are much stronger, but then they are very expensive, and take up a
great deal of ground, so that, in my opinion, they are most of use to cover
or defend the head of a camp; otherwise the double tenaille--By the mother
who bore us!--brother Toby, quoth my father, not able to hold out any
longer,--you would provoke a saint;--here have you got us, I know not how,
not only souse into the middle of the old subject again:--But so full is
your head of these confounded works, that though my wife is this moment in
the pains of labour, and you hear her cry out, yet nothing will serve you
but to carry off the man-midwife.--Accoucheur,--if you please, quoth Dr.
Slop.--With all my heart, replied my father, I don't care what they call
you,--but I wish the whole science of fortification, with all its
inventors, at the devil;--it has been the death of thousands,--and it will
be mine in the end.--I would not, I would not, brother Toby, have my brains
so full of saps, mines, blinds, gabions, pallisadoes, ravelins, half-moons,
and such trumpery, to be proprietor of Namur, and of all the towns in
Flanders with it.
My uncle Toby was a man patient of injuries;--not from want of courage,--I
have told you in a former chapter, 'that he was a man of courage:'--And
will add here, that where just occasions presented, or called it forth,--I
know no man under whose arm I would have sooner taken shelter;--nor did
this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual parts;-
-for he felt this insult of my father's as feelingly as a man could do;--
but he was of a peaceful, placid nature,--no jarring element in it,--all
was mixed up so kindly within him; my uncle Toby had scarce a heart to
retaliate upon a fly.
--Go--says he, one day at dinner, to an over-grown one which had buzzed
about his nose, and tormented him cruelly all dinner-time,--and which after
infinite attempts, he had caught at last, as it flew by him;--I'll not hurt
thee, says my uncle Toby, rising from his chair, and going across the room,
with the fly in his hand,--I'll not hurt a hair of thy head:--Go, says he,
lifting up the sash, and opening his hand as he spoke, to let it escape;--
go, poor devil, get thee gone, why should I hurt thee?--This world surely
is wide enough to hold both thee and me.
I was but ten years old when this happened: but whether it was, that the
action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity, which
instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of most pleasurable
sensation;--or how far the manner and expression of it might go towards
it;--or in what degree, or by what secret magick,--a tone of voice and
harmony of movement, attuned by mercy, might find a passage to my heart, I
know not;--this I know, that the lesson of universal good-will then taught
and imprinted by my uncle Toby, has never since been worn out of my mind: 
And tho' I would not depreciate what the study of the Literae humaniores,
at the university, have done for me in that respect, or discredit the other
helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me, both at home and abroad
since;--yet I often think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that
one accidental impression.
This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume upon
the subject.
I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle Toby's picture, by the
instrument with which I drew the other parts of it,--that taking in no more
than the mere Hobby-Horsical likeness:--this is a part of his moral
character. My father, in this patient endurance of wrongs, which I
mention, was very different, as the reader must long ago have noted; he had
a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature, attended with a little
soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing which
looked like malignancy:--yet in the little rubs and vexations of life,
'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishness:--He
was, however, frank and generous in his nature;--at all times open to
conviction; and in the little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards
others, but particularly towards my uncle Toby, whom he truly loved:--he
would feel more pain, ten times told (except in the affair of my aunt
Dinah, or where an hypothesis was concerned) than what he ever gave.
The characters of the two brothers, in this view of them, reflected light
upon each other, and appeared with great advantage in this affair which
arose about Stevinus.
I need not tell the reader, if he keeps a Hobby-Horse,--that a man's Hobby-
Horse is as tender a part as he has about him; and that these unprovoked
strokes at my uncle Toby's could not be unfelt by him.--No:--as I said
above, my uncle Toby did feel them, and very sensibly too.
Pray, Sir, what said he?--How did he behave?--O, Sir!--it was great: For
as soon as my father had done insulting his Hobby-Horse,--he turned his
head without the least emotion, from Dr. Slop, to whom he was addressing
his discourse, and looking up into my father's face, with a countenance
spread over with so much good-nature;--so placid;--so fraternal;--so
inexpressibly tender towards him:--it penetrated my father to his heart: 
He rose up hastily from his chair, and seizing hold of both my uncle Toby's
hands as he spoke:--Brother Toby, said he:--I beg thy pardon;--forgive, I
pray thee, this rash humour which my mother gave me.--My dear, dear
brother, answered my uncle Toby, rising up by my father's help, say no more
about it;--you are heartily welcome, had it been ten times as much,
brother. But 'tis ungenerous, replied my father, to hurt any man;--a
brother worse;--but to hurt a brother of such gentle manners,--so
unprovoking,--and so unresenting;--'tis base:--By Heaven, 'tis cowardly.--
You are heartily welcome, brother, quoth my uncle Toby,--had it been fifty
times as much.--Besides, what have I to do, my dear Toby, cried my father,
either with your amusements or your pleasures, unless it was in my power
(which it is not) to increase their measure?
--Brother Shandy, answered my uncle Toby, looking wistfully in his face,--
you are much mistaken in this point:--for you do increase my pleasure very
much, in begetting children for the Shandy family at your time of life.--
But, by that, Sir, quoth Dr. Slop, Mr. Shandy increases his own.--Not a
jot, quoth my father.
Chapter 1.XXXVIII.
My brother does it, quoth my uncle Toby, out of principle.--In a family
way, I suppose, quoth Dr. Slop.--Pshaw!--said my father,--'tis not worth
talking of.
Chapter 1.XXXIX.
At the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle Toby were left both
standing, like Brutus and Cassius, at the close of the scene, making up
their accounts.
As my father spoke the three last words,--he sat down;--my uncle Toby
exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he rung
the bell, to order Corporal Trim, who was in waiting, to step home for
Stevinus:--my uncle Toby's house being no farther off than the opposite
side of the way.
Some men would have dropped the subject of Stevinus;--but my uncle Toby had
no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew my
father that he had none.
Your sudden appearance, Dr. Slop, quoth my uncle, resuming the discourse,
instantly brought Stevinus into my head. (My father, you may be sure, did
not offer to lay any more wagers upon Stevinus's head.)--Because, continued
my uncle Toby, the celebrated sailing chariot, which belonged to Prince
Maurice, and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity, as to carry
half a dozen people thirty German miles, in I don't know how few minutes,--
was invented by Stevinus, that great mathematician and engineer.
You might have spared your servant the trouble, quoth Dr. Slop (as the
fellow is lame) of going for Stevinus's account of it, because in my return
from Leyden thro' the Hague, I walked as far as Schevling, which is two
long miles, on purpose to take a view of it.
That's nothing, replied my uncle Toby, to what the learned Peireskius did,
who walked a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from Paris to
Schevling, and from Schevling to Paris back again, in order to see it, and
nothing else.
Some men cannot bear to be out-gone.
The more fool Peireskius, replied Dr. Slop. But mark, 'twas out of no
contempt of Peireskius at all;--but that Peireskius's indefatigable labour
in trudging so far on foot, out of love for the sciences, reduced the
exploit of Dr. Slop, in that affair, to nothing:--the more fool Peireskius,
said he again.--Why so?--replied my father, taking his brother's part, not
only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given
him, which sat still upon my father's mind;--but partly, that my father
began really to interest himself in the discourse.--Why so?--said he. Why
is Peireskius, or any man else, to be abused for an appetite for that, or
any other morsel of sound knowledge: For notwithstanding I know nothing of
the chariot in question, continued he, the inventor of it must have had a
very mechanical head; and tho' I cannot guess upon what principles of
philosophy he has atchieved it;--yet certainly his machine has been
constructed upon solid ones, be they what they will, or it could not have
answered at the rate my brother mentions.
It answered, replied my uncle Toby, as well, if not better; for, as
Peireskius elegantly expresses it, speaking of the velocity of its motion,
Tam citus erat, quam erat ventus; which, unless I have forgot my Latin, is,
that it was as swift as the wind itself.
But pray, Dr. Slop, quoth my father, interrupting my uncle (tho' not
without begging pardon for it at the same time) upon what principles was
this self-same chariot set a-going?--Upon very pretty principles to be
sure, replied Dr. Slop:--And I have often wondered, continued he, evading
the question, why none of our gentry, who live upon large plains like this
of ours,--(especially they whose wives are not past child-bearing) attempt
nothing of this kind; for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon
sudden calls, to which the sex is subject,--if the wind only served,--but
would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds, which cost
nothing, and which eat nothing, rather than horses, which (the devil take
'em) both cost and eat a great deal.
For that very reason, replied my father, 'Because they cost nothing, and
because they eat nothing,'--the scheme is bad;--it is the consumption of
our products, as well as the manufactures of them, which gives bread to the
hungry, circulates trade,--brings in money, and supports the value of our
lands;--and tho', I own, if I was a Prince, I would generously recompense
the scientifick head which brought forth such contrivances;--yet I would as
peremptorily suppress the use of them.
My father here had got into his element,--and was going on as prosperously
with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle Toby had before, upon his of
fortification;--but to the loss of much sound knowledge, the destinies in
the morning had decreed that no dissertation of any kind should be spun by
my father that day,--for as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence,
Chapter 1.XL.
In popped Corporal Trim with Stevinus:--But 'twas too late,--all the
discourse had been exhausted without him, and was running into a new
channel.
--You may take the book home again, Trim, said my uncle Toby, nodding to
him.
But prithee, Corporal, quoth my father, drolling,--look first into it, and
see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it.
Corporal Trim, by being in the service, had learned to obey,--and not to
remonstrate,--so taking the book to a side-table, and running over the
leaves; An' please your Honour, said Trim, I can see no such thing;--
however, continued the Corporal, drolling a little in his turn, I'll make
sure work of it, an' please your Honour;--so taking hold of the two covers
of the book, one in each hand, and letting the leaves fall down as he bent
the covers back, he gave the book a good sound shake.
There is something falling out, however, said Trim, an' please your
Honour;--but it is not a chariot, or any thing like one:--Prithee,
Corporal, said my father, smiling, what is it then?--I think, answered
Trim, stooping to take it up,--'tis more like a sermon,--for it begins with
a text of scripture, and the chapter and verse;--and then goes on, not as a
chariot, but like a sermon directly.
The company smiled.
I cannot conceive how it is possible, quoth my uncle Toby, for such a thing
as a sermon to have got into my Stevinus.
I think 'tis a sermon, replied Trim:--but if it please your Honours, as it
is a fair hand, I will read you a page;--for Trim, you must know, loved to
hear himself read almost as well as talk.
I have ever a strong propensity, said my father, to look into things which
cross my way, by such strange fatalities as these;--and as we have nothing
better to do, at least till Obadiah gets back, I shall be obliged to you,
brother, if Dr. Slop has no objection to it, to order the Corporal to give
us a page or two of it,--if he is as able to do it, as he seems willing. 
An' please your honour, quoth Trim, I officiated two whole campaigns, in
Flanders, as clerk to the chaplain of the regiment.--He can read it, quoth
my uncle Toby, as well as I can.--Trim, I assure you, was the best scholar
in my company, and should have had the next halberd, but for the poor
fellow's misfortune. Corporal Trim laid his hand upon his heart, and made
an humble bow to his master; then laying down his hat upon the floor, and
taking up the sermon in his left hand, in order to have his right at
liberty,--he advanced, nothing doubting, into the middle of the room, where
he could best see, and be best seen by his audience.
Chapter 1.XLI.
--If you have any objection,--said my father, addressing himself to Dr.
Slop. Not in the least, replied Dr. Slop;--for it does not appear on which
side of the question it is wrote,--it may be a composition of a divine of
our church, as well as yours,--so that we run equal risques.--'Tis wrote
upon neither side, quoth Trim, for 'tis only upon Conscience, an' please
your Honours.
Trim's reason put his audience into good humour,--all but Dr. Slop, who
turning his head about towards Trim, looked a little angry.
Begin, Trim,--and read distinctly, quoth my father.--I will, an' please
your Honour, replied the Corporal, making a bow, and bespeaking attention
with a slight movement of his right hand.
Chapter 1.XLII.
--But before the Corporal begins, I must first give you a description of
his attitude;--otherwise he will naturally stand represented, by your
imagination, in an uneasy posture,--stiff,--perpendicular,--dividing the
weight of his body equally upon both legs;--his eye fixed, as if on duty;--
his look determined,--clenching the sermon in his left hand, like his
firelock.--In a word, you would be apt to paint Trim, as if he was standing
in his platoon ready for action,--His attitude was as unlike all this as
you can conceive.
He stood before them with his body swayed, and bent forwards just so far,
as to make an angle of 85 degrees and a half upon the plain of the
horizon;--which sound orators, to whom I address this, know very well to be
the true persuasive angle of incidence;--in any other angle you may talk
and preach;--'tis certain;--and it is done every day;--but with what
effect,--I leave the world to judge!
The necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a
mathematical exactness,--does it not shew us, by the way, how the arts and
sciences mutually befriend each other?
How the duce Corporal Trim, who knew not so much as an acute angle from an
obtuse one, came to hit it so exactly;--or whether it was chance or nature,
or good sense or imitation, &c. shall be commented upon in that part of the
cyclopaedia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental parts of the
eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, and the bar, the coffee-house, the
bed-chamber, and fire-side, fall under consideration.
He stood,--for I repeat it, to take the picture of him in at one view, with
his body swayed, and somewhat bent forwards,--his right leg from under him,
sustaining seven-eighths of his whole weight,--the foot of his left leg,
the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude, advanced a
little,--not laterally, nor forwards, but in a line betwixt them;--his knee
bent, but that not violently,--but so as to fall within the limits of the
line of beauty;--and I add, of the line of science too;--for consider, it
had one eighth part of his body to bear up;--so that in this case the
position of the leg is determined,--because the foot could be no farther
advanced, or the knee more bent, than what would allow him, mechanically to
receive an eighth part of his whole weight under it, and to carry it too.
>This I recommend to painters;--need I add,--to orators!--I think not; for
unless they practise it,--they must fall upon their noses.
So much for Corporal Trim's body and legs.--He held the sermon loosely, not
carelessly, in his left hand, raised something above his stomach, and
detached a little from his breast;--his right arm falling negligently by
his side, as nature and the laws of gravity ordered it,--but with the palm
of it open and turned towards his audience, ready to aid the sentiment in
case it stood in need.
Corporal Trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with
the other parts of him;--he looked frank,--unconstrained,--something
assured,--but not bordering upon assurance.
Let not the critic ask how Corporal Trim could come by all this.--I've told
him it should be explained;--but so he stood before my father, my uncle
Toby, and Dr. Slop,--so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs, and with
such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,--a statuary might
have modelled from it;--nay, I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a
College,--or the Hebrew Professor himself, could have much mended it.
Trim made a bow, and read as follows:
The Sermon.
Hebrews xiii. 18.
--For we trust we have a good Conscience.
'Trust!--Trust we have a good conscience!'
(Certainly, Trim, quoth my father, interrupting him, you give that sentence
a very improper accent; for you curl up your nose, man, and read it with
such a sneering tone, as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle.
He is, an' please your Honour, replied Trim. Pugh! said my father,
smiling.
Sir, quoth Dr. Slop, Trim is certainly in the right; for the writer (who I
perceive is a Protestant) by the snappish manner in which he takes up the
apostle, is certainly going to abuse him;--if this treatment of him has not
done it already. But from whence, replied my father, have you concluded so
soon, Dr. Slop, that the writer is of our church?--for aught I can see
yet,--he may be of any church.--Because, answered Dr. Slop, if he was of
ours,--he durst no more take such a licence,--than a bear by his beard:--
If, in our communion, Sir, a man was to insult an apostle,--a saint,--or
even the paring of a saint's nail,--he would have his eyes scratched out.--
What, by the saint? quoth my uncle Toby. No, replied Dr. Slop, he would
have an old house over his head. Pray is the Inquisition an ancient
building, answered my uncle Toby, or is it a modern one?--I know nothing of
architecture, replied Dr. Slop.--An' please your Honours, quoth Trim, the
Inquisition is the vilest--Prithee spare thy description, Trim, I hate the
very name of it, said my father.--No matter for that, answered Dr. Slop,--
it has its uses; for tho' I'm no great advocate for it, yet, in such a case
as this, he would soon be taught better manners; and I can tell him, if he
went on at that rate, would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains. 
God help him then, quoth my uncle Toby. Amen, added Trim; for Heaven above
knows, I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it.--
I never heard one word of it before, said my uncle Toby, hastily:--How came
he there, Trim?--O, Sir, the story will make your heart bleed,--as it has
made mine a thousand times;--but it is too long to be told now;--your
Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside
you in our fortifications;--but the short of the story is this;--That my
brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbon,--and then married a Jew's widow,
who kept a small shop, and sold sausages, which somehow or other, was the
cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed, where
he was lying with his wife and two small children, and carried directly to
the Inquisition, where, God help him, continued Trim, fetching a sigh from
the bottom of his heart,--the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour;
he was as honest a soul, added Trim, (pulling out his handkerchief) as ever
blood warmed.--
--The tears trickled down Trim's cheeks faster than he could well wipe them
away.--A dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes.--Certain proof
of pity!
Come Trim, quoth my father, after he saw the poor fellow's grief had got a
little vent,--read on,--and put this melancholy story out of thy head:--I
grieve that I interrupted thee; but prithee begin the sermon again;--for if
the first sentence in it is matter of abuse, as thou sayest, I have a great
desire to know what kind of provocation the apostle has given.
Corporal Trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into his
pocket, and, making a bow as he did it,--he began again.)
The Sermon.
Hebrews xiii. 18.
--For we trust we have a good Conscience.--
'Trust! trust we have a good conscience! Surely if there is any thing in
this life which a man may depend upon, and to the knowledge of which he is
capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence, it must be this
very thing,--whether he has a good conscience or no.'
(I am positive I am right, quoth Dr. Slop.)
'If a man thinks at all, he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of
this account:--he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires;--he must
remember his past pursuits, and know certainly the true springs and
motives, which, in general, have governed the actions of his life.'
(I defy him, without an assistant, quoth Dr. Slop.)
'In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances; and, as the wise
man complains, hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the
earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us. But here
the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself;--is conscious of
the web she has wove;--knows its texture and fineness, and the exact share
which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which
virtue or vice has planned before her.'
(The language is good, and I declare Trim reads very well, quoth my
father.)
'Now,--as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has
within herself of this; and the judgment, either of approbation or censure,
which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives; 'tis
plain you will say, from the very terms of the proposition,--whenever this
inward testimony goes against a man, and he stands self-accused, that he
must necessarily be a guilty man.--And, on the contrary, when the report is
favourable on his side, and his heart condemns him not:--that it is not a
matter of trust, as the apostle intimates, but a matter of certainty and
fact, that the conscience is good, and that the man must be good also.'
(Then the apostle is altogether in the wrong, I suppose, quoth Dr. Slop,
and the Protestant divine is in the right. Sir, have patience, replied my
father, for I think it will presently appear that St. Paul and the
Protestant divine are both of an opinion.--As nearly so, quoth Dr. Slop, as
east is to west;--but this, continued he, lifting both hands, comes from
the liberty of the press.
It is no more at the worst, replied my uncle Toby, than the liberty of the
pulpit; for it does not appear that the sermon is printed, or ever likely
to be.
Go on, Trim, quoth my father.)
'At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case: and I make
no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon
the mind of man,--that did no such thing ever happen, as that the
conscience of a man, by long habits of sin, might (as the scripture assures
it may) insensibly become hard;--and, like some tender parts of his body,
by much stress and continual hard usage, lose by degrees that nice sense
and perception with which God and nature endowed it:--Did this never
happen;--or was it certain that self-love could never hang the least bias
upon the judgment;--or that the little interests below could rise up and
perplex the faculties of our upper regions, and encompass them about with
clouds and thick darkness:--Could no such thing as favour and affection
enter this sacred Court--Did Wit disdain to take a bribe in it;--or was
ashamed to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment: 
Or, lastly, were we assured that Interest stood always unconcerned whilst
the cause was hearing--and that Passion never got into the judgment-seat,
and pronounced sentence in the stead of Reason, which is supposed always to
preside and determine upon the case:--Was this truly so, as the objection
must suppose;--no doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would
be exactly what he himself esteemed it:--and the guilt or innocence of
every man's life could be known, in general, by no better measure, than the
degrees of his own approbation and censure.
'I own, in one case, whenever a man's conscience does accuse him (as it
seldom errs on that side) that he is guilty;--and unless in melancholy and
hypocondriac cases, we may safely pronounce upon it, that there is always
sufficient grounds for the accusation.
'But the converse of the proposition will not hold true;--namely, that
whenever there is guilt, the conscience must accuse; and if it does not,
that a man is therefore innocent.--This is not fact--So that the common
consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administering to
himself,--that he thanks God his mind does not misgive him; and that,
consequently, he has a good conscience, because he hath a quiet one,--is
fallacious;--and as current as the inference is, and as infallible as the
rule appears at first sight, yet when you look nearer to it, and try the
truth of this rule upon plain facts,--you see it liable to so much error
from a false application;--the principle upon which it goes so often
perverted;--the whole force of it lost, and sometimes so vilely cast away,
that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life, which
confirm the account.
'A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles;--
exceptionable in his conduct to the world; shall live shameless, in the
open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can justify,--a sin by
which, contrary to all the workings of humanity, he shall ruin for ever the
deluded partner of his guilt;--rob her of her best dowry; and not only
cover her own head with dishonour;--but involve a whole virtuous family in
shame and sorrow for her sake. Surely, you will think conscience must lead
such a man a troublesome life; he can have no rest night and day from its
reproaches.
'Alas! Conscience had something else to do all this time, than break in
upon him; as Elijah reproached the god Baal,--this domestic god was either
talking, or pursuing, or was in a journey, or peradventure he slept and
could not be awoke.
'Perhaps He was gone out in company with Honour to fight a duel: to pay off
some debt at play;--or dirty annuity, the bargain of his lust; Perhaps
Conscience all this time was engaged at home, talking aloud against petty
larceny, and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune
and rank of life secured him against all temptation of committing; so that
he lives as merrily;'--(If he was of our church, tho', quoth Dr. Slop, he
could not)--'sleeps as soundly in his bed;--and at last meets death
unconcernedly;--perhaps much more so, than a much better man.'
(All this is impossible with us, quoth Dr. Slop, turning to my father,--the
case could not happen in our church.--It happens in ours, however, replied
my father, but too often.--I own, quoth Dr. Slop, (struck a little with my
father's frank acknowledgment)--that a man in the Romish church may live as
badly;--but then he cannot easily die so.--'Tis little matter, replied my
father, with an air of indifference,--how a rascal dies.--I mean, answered
Dr. Slop, he would be denied the benefits of the last sacraments.--Pray how
many have you in all, said my uncle Toby,--for I always forget?--Seven,
answered Dr. Slop.--Humph!--said my uncle Toby; tho' not accented as a note
of acquiescence,--but as an interjection of that particular species of
surprize, when a man in looking into a drawer, finds more of a thing than
he expected.--Humph! replied my uncle Toby. Dr. Slop, who had an ear,
understood my uncle Toby as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against
the seven sacraments.--Humph! replied Dr. Slop, (stating my uncle Toby's
argument over again to him)--Why, Sir, are there not seven cardinal
virtues?--Seven mortal sins?--Seven golden candlesticks?--Seven heavens?--
'Tis more than I know, replied my uncle Toby.--Are there not seven wonders
of the world?--Seven days of the creation?--Seven planets?--Seven plagues?-
-That there are, quoth my father with a most affected gravity. But
prithee, continued he, go on with the rest of thy characters, Trim.)
'Another is sordid, unmerciful,' (here Trim waved his right hand) 'a
strait-hearted, selfish wretch, incapable either of private friendship or
public spirit. Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their
distress, and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh
or a prayer.' (An' please your honours, cried Trim, I think this a viler
man than the other.)
'Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasions?--No; thank
God there is no occasion, I pay every man his own;--I have no fornication
to answer to my conscience;--no faithless vows or promises to make up;--I
have debauched no man's wife or child; thank God, I am not as other men,
adulterers, unjust, or even as this libertine, who stands before me.
'A third is crafty and designing in his nature. View his whole life;--'tis
nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges,
basely to defeat the true intent of all laws,--plain dealing and the safe
enjoyment of our several properties.--You will see such a one working out a
frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and
needy man;--shall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth, or the
unsuspecting temper of his friend, who would have trusted him with his
life.
'When old age comes on, and repentance calls him to look back upon this
black account, and state it over again with his conscience--Conscience
looks into the Statutes at Large;--finds no express law broken by what he
has done;--perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels
incurred;--sees no scourge waving over his head, or prison opening his
gates upon him:--What is there to affright his conscience?--Conscience has
got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law; sits there
invulnerable, fortified with Cases and Reports so strongly on all sides;--
that it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold.'
(Here Corporal Trim and my uncle Toby exchanged looks with each other.--
Aye, Aye, Trim! quoth my uncle Toby, shaking his head,--these are but sorry
fortifications, Trim.--O! very poor work, answered Trim, to what your
Honour and I make of it.--The character of this last man, said Dr. Slop,
interrupting Trim, is more detestable than all the rest; and seems to have
been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst you:--Amongst us, a man's
conscience could not possibly continue so long blinded,--three times in a
year, at least, he must go to confession. Will that restore it to sight?
quoth my uncle Toby,--Go on, Trim, quoth my father, or Obadiah will have
got back before thou has got to the end of thy sermon.--'Tis a very short
one, replied Trim.--I wish it was longer, quoth my uncle Toby, for I like
it hugely.--Trim went on.)
'A fourth man shall want even this refuge;--shall break through all their
ceremony of slow chicane;--scorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and
cautious trains to bring about his purpose:--See the bare-faced villain,
how he cheats, lies, perjures, robs, murders!--Horrid!--But indeed much
better was not to be expected, in the present case--the poor man was in the
dark!--his priest had got the keeping of his conscience;--and all he would
let him know of it, was, That he must believe in the Pope;--go to Mass;--
cross himself;--tell his beads;--be a good Catholic, and that this, in all
conscience, was enough to carry him to heaven. What;--if he perjures?--
Why;--he had a mental reservation in it.--But if he is so wicked and
abandoned a wretch as you represent him;--if he robs,--if he stabs, will
not conscience, on every such act, receive a wound itself?--Aye,--but the
man has carried it to confession;--the wound digests there, and will do
well enough, and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution. O
Popery! what hast thou to answer for!--when not content with the too many
natural and fatal ways, thro' which the heart of man is every day thus
treacherous to itself above all things;--thou hast wilfully set open the
wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller, too apt, God
knows, to go astray of himself, and confidently speak peace to himself,
when there is no peace.
'Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life, are too
notorious to require much evidence. If any man doubts the reality of them,
or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself,--I must
refer him a moment to his own reflections, and will then venture to trust
my appeal with his own heart.
'Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation, numbers of
wicked actions stand there, tho' equally bad and vicious in their own
natures;--he will soon find, that such of them as strong inclination and
custom have prompted him to commit, are generally dressed out and painted
with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give
them;--and that the others, to which he feels no propensity, appear, at
once, naked and deformed, surrounded with all the true circumstances of
folly and dishonour.
'When David surprized Saul sleeping in the cave, and cut off the skirt of
his robe--we read his heart smote him for what he had done:--But in the
matter of Uriah, where a faithful and gallant servant, whom he ought to
have loved and honoured, fell to make way for his lust,--where conscience
had so much greater reason to take the alarm, his heart smote him not. A
whole year had almost passed from first commission of that crime, to the
time Nathan was sent to reprove him; and we read not once of the least
sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified, during all that time,
for what he had done.
'Thus conscience, this once able monitor,--placed on high as a judge within
us, and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too,--by an
unhappy train of causes and impediments, takes often such imperfect
cognizance of what passes,--does its office so negligently,--sometimes so
corruptly,--that it is not to be trusted alone; and therefore we find there
is a necessity, an absolute necessity, of joining another principle with
it, to aid, if not govern, its determinations.
'So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite
importance to you not to be misled in,--namely, in what degree of real
merit you stand either as an honest man, an useful citizen, a faithful
subject to your king, or a good servant to your God,--call in religion and
morality.--Look, What is written in the law of God?--How readest thou?--
Consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth;-
-what say they?
'Let Conscience determine the matter upon these reports;--and then if thy
heart condemns thee not, which is the case the apostle supposes,--the rule
will be infallible;'--(Here Dr. Slop fell asleep)--'thou wilt have
confidence towards God;--that is, have just grounds to believe the judgment
thou hast past upon thyself, is the judgment of God; and nothing else but
an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon
thee hereafter by that Being, to whom thou art finally to give an account
of thy actions.
'Blessed is the man, indeed, then, as the author of the book of
Ecclesiasticus expresses it, who is not pricked with the multitude of his
sins: Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemned him; whether he be
rich, or whether he be poor, if he have a good heart (a heart thus guided
and informed) he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful countenance; his
mind shall tell him more than seven watch-men that sit above upon a tower
on high.'--(A tower has no strength, quoth my uncle Toby, unless 'tis
flank'd.)--'in the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a
thousand casuists, and give the state he lives in, a better security for
his behaviour than all the causes and restrictions put together, which law-
makers are forced to multiply:--Forced, I say, as things stand; human laws
not being a matter of original choice, but of pure necessity, brought in to
fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law
unto themselves; well intending, by the many provisions made,--that in all
such corrupt and misguided cases, where principles and the checks of
conscience will not make us upright,--to supply their force, and, by the
terrors of gaols and halters, oblige us to it.'
(I see plainly, said my father, that this sermon has been composed to be
preached at the Temple,--or at some Assize.--I like the reasoning,--and am
sorry that Dr. Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction:--
for it is now clear, that the Parson, as I thought at first, never insulted
St. Paul in the least;--nor has there been, brother, the least difference
between them.--A great matter, if they had differed, replied my uncle
Toby,--the best friends in the world may differ sometimes.--True,--brother
Toby quoth my father, shaking hands with him,--we'll fill our pipes,
brother, and then Trim shall go on.
Well,--what dost thou think of it? said my father, speaking to Corporal
Trim, as he reached his tobacco-box.
I think, answered the Corporal, that the seven watch-men upon the tower,
who, I suppose, are all centinels there,--are more, an' please your Honour,
than were necessary;--and, to go on at that rate, would harrass a regiment
all to pieces, which a commanding officer, who loves his men, will never
do, if he can help it, because two centinels, added the Corporal, are as
good as twenty.--I have been a commanding officer myself in the Corps de
Garde a hundred times, continued Trim, rising an inch higher in his figure,
as he spoke,--and all the time I had the honour to serve his Majesty King
William, in relieving the most considerable posts, I never left more than
two in my life.--Very right, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,--but you do not
consider, Trim, that the towers, in Solomon's days, were not such things as
our bastions, flanked and defended by other works;--this, Trim, was an
invention since Solomon's death; nor had they horn-works, or ravelins
before the curtin, in his time;--or such a fosse as we make with a cuvette
in the middle of it, and with covered ways and counterscarps pallisadoed
along it, to guard against a Coup de main:--So that the seven men upon the
tower were a party, I dare say, from the Corps de Garde, set there, not
only to look out, but to defend it.--They could be no more, an' please your
Honour, than a Corporal's Guard.--My father smiled inwardly, but not
outwardly--the subject being rather too serious, considering what had
happened, to make a jest of.--So putting his pipe into his mouth, which he
had just lighted,--he contented himself with ordering Trim to read on. He
read on as follows:
'To have the fear of God before our eyes, and, in our mutual dealings with
each other, to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and
wrong:--The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion;--the
second, those of morality, which are so inseparably connected together,
that you cannot divide these two tables, even in imagination, (tho' the
attempt is often made in practice) without breaking and mutually destroying
them both.
I said the attempt is often made; and so it is;--there being nothing more
common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion, and indeed
has so much honesty as to pretend to none, who would take it as the
bitterest affront, should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral
character,--or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to
the uttermost mite.
'When there is some appearance that it is so,--tho' one is unwilling even
to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty, yet were
we to look into the grounds of it, in the present case, I am persuaded we
should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive.
'Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject, it will be
found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest, his
pride, his ease, or some such little and changeable passion as will give us
but small dependence upon his actions in matters of great distress.
'I will illustrate this by an example.
'I know the banker I deal with, or the physician I usually call in,'--
(There is no need, cried Dr. Slop, (waking) to call in any physician in
this case)--'to be neither of them men of much religion: I hear them make
a jest of it every day, and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn, as
to put the matter past doubt. Well;--notwithstanding this, I put my
fortune into the hands of the one:--and what is dearer still to me, I trust
my life to the honest skill of the other.
'Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence. Why, in
the first place, I believe there is no probability that either of them will
employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantage;--I consider
that honesty serves the purposes of this life:--I know their success in the
world depends upon the fairness of their characters.--In a word, I'm
persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more.
'But put it otherwise, namely, that interest lay, for once, on the other
side; that a case should happen, wherein the one, without stain to his
reputation, could secrete my fortune, and leave me naked in the world;--or
that the other could send me out of it, and enjoy an estate by my death,
without dishonour to himself or his art:--In this case, what hold have I of
either of them?--Religion, the strongest of all motives, is out of the
question;--Interest, the next most powerful motive in the world, is
strongly against me:--What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to
balance this temptation?--Alas! I have nothing,--nothing but what is
lighter than a bubble--I must lie at the mercy of Honour, or some such
capricious principle--Strait security for two of the most valuable
blessings!--my property and myself.
'As, therefore, we can have no dependence upon morality without religion;--
so, on the other hand, there is nothing better to be expected from religion
without morality; nevertheless, 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real
moral character stands very low, who yet entertains the highest notion of
himself in the light of a religious man.
'He shall not only be covetous, revengeful, implacable,--but even wanting
in points of common honesty; yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the
infidelity of the age,--is zealous for some points of religion,--goes twice
a day to church,--attends the sacraments,--and amuses himself with a few
instrumental parts of religion,--shall cheat his conscience into a
judgment, that, for this, he is a religious man, and has discharged truly
his duty to God: And you will find that such a man, through force of this
delusion, generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man
who has less affectation of piety,--though, perhaps, ten times more real
honesty than himself.
'This likewise is a sore evil under the sun; and I believe, there is no one
mistaken principle, which, for its time, has wrought more serious
mischiefs.--For a general proof of this,--examine the history of the Romish
church;'--(Well what can you make of that? cried Dr. Slop)--'see what
scenes of cruelty, murder, rapine, bloodshed,'--(They may thank their own
obstinacy, cried Dr. Slop)--have all been sanctified by a religion not
strictly governed by morality.
'In how many kingdoms of the world'--(Here Trim kept waving his right-hand
from the sermon to the extent of his arm, returning it backwards and
forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph.)
'In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this
misguided saint-errant, spared neither age or merit, or sex, or condition?-
-and, as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from
justice and humanity, he shewed none; mercilessly trampled upon both,--
heard neither the cries of the unfortunate, nor pitied their distresses.'
(I have been in many a battle, an' please your Honour, quoth Trim, sighing,
but never in so melancholy a one as this,--I would not have drawn a tricker
in it against these poor souls,--to have been made a general officer.--Why?
what do you understand of the affair? said Dr. Slop, looking towards Trim,
with something more of contempt than the Corporal's honest heart deserved.-
-What do you know, friend, about this battle you talk of?--I know, replied
Trim, that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for
it;--but to a woman or a child, continued Trim, before I would level my
musket at them, I would loose my life a thousand times.--Here's a crown for
thee, Trim, to drink with Obadiah to-night, quoth my uncle Toby, and I'll
give Obadiah another too.--God bless your Honour, replied Trim,--I had
rather these poor women and children had it.--thou art an honest fellow,
quoth my uncle Toby.--My father nodded his head, as much as to say--and so
he is.--
But prithee, Trim, said my father, make an end,--for I see thou hast but a
leaf or two left.
Corporal Trim read on.)
'If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient,--
consider at this instant, how the votaries of that religion are every day
thinking to do service and honour to God, by actions which are a dishonour
and scandal to themselves.
'To be convinced of this, go with me for a moment into the prisons of the
Inquisition.'--(God help my poor brother Tom.)--'Behold Religion, with
Mercy and Justice chained down under her feet,--there sitting ghastly upon
a black tribunal, propped up with racks and instruments of torment. Hark!-
-hark! what a piteous groan!'--(Here Trim's face turned as pale as
ashes.)--'See the melancholy wretch who uttered it'--(Here the tears began
to trickle down)--'just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock
trial, and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has
been able to invent.'--(D..n them all, quoth Trim, his colour returning
into his face as red as blood.)--'Behold this helpless victim delivered up
to his tormentors,--his body so wasted with sorrow and confinement.'--(Oh!
'tis my brother, cried poor Trim in a most passionate exclamation, dropping
the sermon upon the ground, and clapping his hands together--I fear 'tis
poor Tom. My father's and my uncle Toby's heart yearned with sympathy for
the poor fellow's distress; even Slop himself acknowledged pity for him.--
Why, Trim, said my father, this is not a history,--'tis a sermon thou art
reading; prithee begin the sentence again.)--'Behold this helpless victim
delivered up to his tormentors,--his body so wasted with sorrow and
confinement, you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers.
'Observe the last movement of that horrid engine!'--(I would rather face a
cannon, quoth Trim, stamping.)--'See what convulsions it has thrown him
into!--Consider the nature of the posture in which he how lies stretched,--
what exquisite tortures he endures by it!'--(I hope 'tis not in Portugal.)-
-''Tis all nature can bear! Good God! see how it keeps his weary soul
hanging upon his trembling lips!' (I would not read another line of it,
quoth Trim for all this world;--I fear, an' please your Honours, all this
is in Portugal, where my poor brother Tom is. I tell thee, Trim, again,
quoth my father, 'tis not an historical account,--'tis a description.--'Tis
only a description, honest man, quoth Slop, there's not a word of truth in
it.--That's another story, replied my father.--However, as Trim reads it
with so much concern,--'tis cruelty to force him to go on with it.--Give me
hold of the sermon, Trim,--I'll finish it for thee, and thou may'st go. I
must stay and hear it too, replied Trim, if your Honour will allow me;--
tho' I would not read it myself for a Colonel's pay.--Poor Trim! quoth my
uncle Toby. My father went on.)
'--Consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretched,--what
exquisite torture he endures by it!--'Tis all nature can bear! Good God! 
See how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips,--willing
to take its leave,--but not suffered to depart!--Behold the unhappy wretch
led back to his cell!'--(Then, thank God, however, quoth Trim, they have
not killed him.)--'See him dragged out of it again to meet the flames, and
the insults in his last agonies, which this principle,--this principle,
that there can be religion without mercy, has prepared for him.'--(Then,
thank God,--he is dead, quoth Trim,--he is out of his pain,--and they have
done their worst at him.--O Sirs!--Hold your peace, Trim, said my father,
going on with the sermon, lest Trim should incense Dr. Slop,--we shall
never have done at this rate.)
'The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is, to trace down
the consequences such a notion has produced, and compare them with the
spirit of Christianity;--'tis the short and decisive rule which our Saviour
hath left us, for these and such like cases, and it is worth a thousand
arguments--By their fruits ye shall know them.
'I will add no farther to the length of this sermon, than by two or three
short and independent rules deducible from it.
'First, Whenever a man talks loudly against religion, always suspect that
it is not his reason, but his passions, which have got the better of his
Creed. A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome
neighbours, and where they separate, depend upon it, 'tis for no other
cause but quietness sake.
'Secondly, When a man, thus represented, tells you in any particular
instance,--That such a thing goes against his conscience,--always believe
he means exactly the same thing, as when he tells you such a thing goes
against his stomach;--a present want of appetite being generally the true
cause of both.
'In a word,--trust that man in nothing, who has not a Conscience in every
thing.
'And, in your own case, remember this plain distinction, a mistake in which
has ruined thousands,--that your conscience is not a law;--No, God and
reason made the law, and have placed conscience within you to determine;--
not, like an Asiatic Cadi, according to the ebbs and flows of his own
passions,--but like a British judge in this land of liberty and good sense,
who makes no new law, but faithfully declares that law which he knows
already written.'
Finis.
Thou hast read the sermon extremely well, Trim, quoth my father.--If he had
spared his comments, replied Dr. Slop,--he would have read it much better. 
I should have read it ten times better, Sir, answered Trim, but that my
heart was so full.--That was the very reason, Trim, replied my father,
which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done; and if the
clergy of our church, continued my father, addressing himself to Dr. Slop,
would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow has
done,--as their compositions are fine;--(I deny it, quoth Dr. Slop)--I
maintain it,--that the eloquence of our pulpits, with such subjects to
enflame it, would be a model for the whole world:--But alas! continued my
father, and I own it, Sir, with sorrow, that, like French politicians in
this respect, what they gain in the cabinet they lose in the field.--'Twere
a pity, quoth my uncle, that this should be lost. I like the sermon well,
replied my father,--'tis dramatick,--and there is something in that way of
writing, when skilfully managed, which catches the attention.--We preach
much in that way with us, said Dr. Slop.--I know that very well, said my
father,--but in a tone and manner which disgusted Dr. Slop, full as much as
his assent, simply, could have pleased him.--But in this, added Dr. Slop, a
little piqued,--our sermons have greatly the advantage, that we never
introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife,
or a martyr or a saint.--There are some very bad characters in this,
however, said my father, and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for
'em.--But pray, quoth my uncle Toby,--who's can this be?--How could it get
into my Stevinus? A man must be as great a conjurer as Stevinus, said my
father, to resolve the second question:--The first, I think, is not so
difficult;--for unless my judgment greatly deceives me,--I know the author,
for 'tis wrote, certainly, by the parson of the parish.
The similitude of the stile and manner of it, with those my father
constantly had heard preached in his parish-church, was the ground of his
conjecture,--proving it as strongly, as an argument a priori could prove
such a thing to a philosophic mind, That it was Yorick's and no one's
else:--It was proved to be so, a posteriori, the day after, when Yorick
sent a servant to my uncle Toby's house to enquire after it.
It seems that Yorick, who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge, had
borrowed Stevinus of my uncle Toby, and had carelesly popped his sermon, as
soon as he had made it, into the middle of Stevinus; and by an act of
forgetfulness, to which he was ever subject, he had sent Stevinus home, and
his sermon to keep him company.
Ill-fated sermon! Thou wast lost, after this recovery of thee, a second
time, dropped thru' an unsuspected fissure in thy master's pocket, down
into a treacherous and a tattered lining,--trod deep into the dirt by the
left hind-foot of his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou
falledst;--buried ten days in the mire,--raised up out of it by a beggar,--
sold for a halfpenny to a parish-clerk,--transferred to his parson,--lost
for ever to thy own, the remainder of his days,--nor restored to his
restless Manes till this very moment, that I tell the world the story.
Can the reader believe, that this sermon of Yorick's was preached at an
assize, in the cathedral of York, before a thousand witnesses, ready to
give oath of it, by a certain prebendary of that church, and actually
printed by him when he had done,--and within so short a space as two years
and three months after Yorick's death?--Yorick indeed, was never better
served in his life;--but it was a little hard to maltreat him after, and
plunder him after he was laid in his grave.
However, as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with Yorick,--
and, in conscious justice, printed but a few copies to give away;--and that
I am told he could moreover have made as good a one himself, had he thought
fit,--I declare I would not have published this anecdote to the world;--nor
do I publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in the
church;--I leave that to others;--but I find myself impelled by two
reasons, which I cannot withstand.
The first is, That in doing justice, I may give rest to Yorick's ghost;--
which--as the country-people, and some others believe,--still walks.
The second reason is, That, by laying open this story to the world, I gain
an opportunity of informing it,--That in case the character of parson
Yorick, and this sample of his sermons, is liked,--there are now in the
possession of the Shandy family, as many as will make a handsome volume, at
the world's service,--and much good may they do it.
Chapter 1.XLIII.
Obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;--for he came in jingling,
with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of, flung across
his body, just as Corporal Trim went out of the room.
It is now proper, I think, quoth Dr. Slop, (clearing up his looks) as we
are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs. Shandy, to send up stairs
to know how she goes on.
I have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us upon
the least difficulty;--for you must know, Dr. Slop, continued my father,
with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by express
treaty, solemnly ratified between me and my wife, you are no more than an
auxiliary in this affair,--and not so much as that,--unless the lean old
mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without you.--Women have their
particular fancies, and in points of this nature, continued my father,
where they bear the whole burden, and suffer so much acute pain for the
advantage of our families, and the good of the species,--they claim a right
of deciding, en Souveraines, in whose hands, and in what fashion, they
choose to undergo it.
They are in the right of it,--quoth my uncle Toby. But Sir, replied Dr.
Slop, not taking notice of my uncle Toby's opinion, but turning to my
father,--they had better govern in other points;--and a father of a family,
who wishes its perpetuity, in my opinion, had better exchange this
prerogative with them, and give up some other rights in lieu of it.--I know
not, quoth my father, answering a letter too testily, to be quite
dispassionate in what he said,--I know not, quoth he, what we have left to
give up, in lieu of who shall bring our children into the world, unless
that,--of who shall beget them.--One would almost give up any thing,
replied Dr. Slop.--I beg your pardon,--answered my uncle Toby.--Sir,
replied Dr. Slop, it would astonish you to know what improvements we have
made of late years in all branches of obstetrical knowledge, but
particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious
extraction of the foetus,--which has received such lights, that, for my
part (holding up his hand) I declare I wonder how the world has--I wish,
quoth my uncle Toby, you had seen what prodigious armies we had in
Flanders.
Chapter 1.XLIV.
I have dropped the curtain over this scene for a minute,--to remind you of
one thing,--and to inform you of another.
What I have to inform you, comes, I own, a little out of its due course;--
for it should have been told a hundred and fifty pages ago, but that I
foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter, and be of more advantage here
than elsewhere.--Writers had need look before them, to keep up the spirit
and connection of what they have in hand.
When these two things are done,--the curtain shall be drawn up again, and
my uncle Toby, my father, and Dr. Slop, shall go on with their discourse,
without any more interruption.
First, then, the matter which I have to remind you of, is this;--that from
the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of
Christian-names, and that other previous point thereto,--you was led, I
think, into an opinion,--(and I am sure I said as much) that my father was
a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions. In
truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very first act of
his begetting,--down to the lean and slippered pantaloon in his second
childishness, but he had some favourite notion to himself, springing out of
it, as sceptical, and as far out of the high-way of thinking, as these two
which have been explained.
--Mr. Shandy, my father, Sir, would see nothing in the light in which
others placed it;--he placed things in his own light;--he would weigh
nothing in common scales;--no, he was too refined a researcher to lie open
to so gross an imposition.--To come at the exact weight of things in the
scientific steel-yard, the fulcrum, he would say, should be almost
invisible, to avoid all friction from popular tenets;--without this the
minutiae of philosophy, which would always turn the balance, will have no
weight at all. Knowledge, like matter, he would affirm, was divisible in
infinitum;--that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it, as the
gravitation of the whole world.--In a word, he would say, error was error,-
-no matter where it fell,--whether in a fraction,--or a pound,--'twas alike
fatal to truth, and she was kept down at the bottom of her well, as
inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly's wing,--as in the disk
of the sun, the moon, and all the stars of heaven put together.
He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly,
and of applying it skilfully to civil matters, as well as to speculative
truths, that so many things in this world were out of joint;--that the
political arch was giving way;--and that the very foundations of our
excellent constitution in church and state, were so sapped as estimators
had reported.
You cry out, he would say, we are a ruined, undone people. Why? he would
ask, making use of the sorites or syllogism of Zeno and Chrysippus, without
knowing it belonged to them.--Why? why are we a ruined people?--Because we
are corrupted.--Whence is it, dear Sir, that we are corrupted?--Because we
are needy;--our poverty, and not our wills, consent.--And wherefore, he
would add, are we needy?--From the neglect, he would answer, of our pence
and our halfpence:--Our bank notes, Sir, our guineas,--nay our shillings
take care of themselves.
'Tis the same, he would say, throughout the whole circle of the sciences;--
the great, the established points of them, are not to be broke in upon.--
The laws of nature will defend themselves;--but error--(he would add,
looking earnestly at my mother)--error, Sir, creeps in thro' the minute
holes and small crevices which human nature leaves unguarded.
This turn of thinking in my father, is what I had to remind you of:--The
point you are to be informed of, and which I have reserved for this place,
is as follows.
Amongst the many and excellent reasons, with which my father had urged my
mother to accept of Dr. Slop's assistance preferably to that of the old
woman,--there was one of a very singular nature; which, when he had done
arguing the matter with her as a Christian, and came to argue it over again
with her as a philosopher, he had put his whole strength to, depending
indeed upon it as his sheet-anchor.--It failed him, tho' from no defect in
the argument itself; but that, do what he could, he was not able for his
soul to make her comprehend the drift of it.--Cursed luck!--said he to
himself, one afternoon, as he walked out of the room, after he had been
stating it for an hour and a half to her, to no manner of purpose;--cursed
luck! said he, biting his lip as he shut the door,--for a man to be master
of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature,--and have a wife at the
same time with such a head-piece, that he cannot hang up a single inference
within side of it, to save his soul from destruction.
This argument, though it was entirely lost upon my mother,--had more weight
with him, than all his other arguments joined together:--I will therefore
endeavour to do it justice,--and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am
master of.
My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms:
First, That an ounce of a man's own wit, was worth a ton of other people's;
and,
Secondly, (Which by the bye, was the ground-work of the first axiom,--tho'
it comes last) That every man's wit must come from every man's own soul,--
and no other body's.
Now, as it was plain to my father, that all souls were by nature equal,--
and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse
understanding--was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking
substance above or below another,--but arose merely from the lucky or
unlucky organization of the body, in that part where the soul principally
took up her residence,--he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find
out the identical place.
Now, from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter, he was
satisfied it could not be where Des Cartes had fixed it, upon the top of
the pineal gland of the brain; which, as he philosophized, formed a cushion
for her about the size of a marrow pea; tho' to speak the truth, as so many
nerves did terminate all in that one place,--'twas no bad conjecture;--and
my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the
centre of the mistake, had it not been for my uncle Toby, who rescued him
out of it, by a story he told him of a Walloon officer at the battle of
Landen, who had one part of his brain shot away by a musket-ball,--and
another part of it taken out after by a French surgeon; and after all,
recovered, and did his duty very well without it.
If death, said my father, reasoning with himself, is nothing but the
separation of the soul from the body;--and if it is true that people can
walk about and do their business without brains,--then certes the soul does
not inhabit there. Q.E.D.
As for that certain, very thin, subtle and very fragrant juice which
Coglionissimo Borri, the great Milaneze physician affirms, in a letter to
Bartholine, to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts of
the cerebellum, and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of
the reasonable soul, (for, you must know, in these latter and more
enlightened ages, there are two souls in every man living,--the one,
according to the great Metheglingius, being called the Animus, the other,
the Anima;)--as for the opinion, I say of Borri,--my father could never
subscribe to it by any means; the very idea of so noble, so refined, so
immaterial, and so exalted a being as the Anima, or even the Animus, taking
up her residence, and sitting dabbling, like a tad-pole all day long, both
summer and winter, in a puddle,--or in a liquid of any kind, how thick or
thin soever, he would say, shocked his imagination; he would scarce give
the doctrine a hearing.
What, therefore, seemed the least liable to objections of any, was that the
chief sensorium, or head-quarters of the soul, and to which place all
intelligences were referred, and from whence all her mandates were issued,-
-was in, or near, the cerebellum,--or rather somewhere about the medulla
oblongata, wherein it was generally agreed by Dutch anatomists, that all
the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered, like
streets and winding alleys, into a square.
So far there was nothing singular in my father's opinion,--he had the best
of philosophers, of all ages and climates, to go along with him.--But here
he took a road of his own, setting up another Shandean hypothesis upon
these corner-stones they had laid for him;--and which said hypothesis
equally stood its ground; whether the subtilty and fineness of the soul
depended upon the temperature and clearness of the said liquor, or of the
finer net-work and texture in the cerebellum itself; which opinion he
favoured.
He maintained, that next to the due care to be taken in the act of
propagation of each individual, which required all the thought in the
world, as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture, in
which wit, memory, fancy, eloquence, and what is usually meant by the name
of good natural parts, do consist;--that next to this and his Christian-
name, which were the two original and most efficacious causes of all;--that
the third cause, or rather what logicians call the Causa sina qua non, and
without which all that was done was of no manner of significance,--was the
preservation of this delicate and fine-spun web, from the havock which was
generally made in it by the violent compression and crush which the head
was made to undergo, by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the
world by that foremost.
--This requires explanation.
My father, who dipped into all kinds of books, upon looking into
Lithopaedus Senonesis de Portu difficili, (The author is here twice
mistaken; for Lithopaedus should be wrote thus, Lithopaedii Senonensis
Icon. The second mistake is, that this Lithopaedus is not an author, but a
drawing of a petrified child. The account of this, published by Athosius
1580, may be seen at the end of Cordaeus's works in Spachius. Mr. Tristram
Shandy has been led into this error, either from seeing Lithopaedus's name
of late in a catalogue of learned writers in Dr. . ., or by mistaking
Lithopaedus for Trinecavellius,--from the too great similitude of the
names.) published by Adrianus Smelvgot, had found out, that the lax and
pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the bones of the cranium
having no sutures at that time, was such,--that by force of the woman's
efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was equal, upon an average, to the
weight of 470 pounds avoirdupois acting perpendicularly upon it;--it so
happened, that in 49 instances out of 50, the said head was compressed and
moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough, such as a
pastry-cook generally rolls up in order to make a pye of.--Good God! cried
my father, what havock and destruction must this make in the infinitely
fine and tender texture of the cerebellum!--Or if there is such a juice as
Borri pretends--is it not enough to make the clearest liquid in the world
both seculent and mothery?
But how great was his apprehension, when he farther understood, that this
force acting upon the very vertex of the head, not only injured the brain
itself, or cerebrum,--but that it necessarily squeezed and propelled the
cerebrum towards the cerebellum, which was the immediate seat of the
understanding!--Angels and ministers of grace defend us! cried my father,--
can any soul withstand this shock?--No wonder the intellectual web is so
rent and tattered as we see it; and that so many of our best heads are no
better than a puzzled skein of silk,--all perplexity,--all confusion
within-side.
But when my father read on, and was let into the secret, that when a child
was turned topsy-turvy, which was easy for an operator to do, and was
extracted by the feet;--that instead of the cerebrum being propelled
towards the cerebellum, the cerebellum, on the contrary, was propelled
simply towards the cerebrum, where it could do no manner of hurt:--By
heavens! cried he, the world is in conspiracy to drive out what little wit
God has given us,--and the professors of the obstetric art are listed into
the same conspiracy.--What is it to me which end of my son comes foremost
into the world, provided all goes right after, and his cerebellum escapes
uncrushed?
It is the nature of an hypothesis, when once a man has conceived it, that
it assimilates every thing to itself, as proper nourishment; and, from the
first moment of your begetting it, it generally grows the stronger by every
thing you see, hear, read, or understand. This is of great use.
When my father was gone with this about a month, there was scarce a
phaenomenon of stupidity or of genius, which he could not readily solve by
it;--it accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in the
family.--Poor devil, he would say,--he made way for the capacity of his
younger brothers.--It unriddled the observations of drivellers and
monstrous heads,--shewing a priori, it could not be otherwise,--unless . .
. I don't know what. It wonderfully explained and accounted for the acumen
of the Asiatic genius, and that sprightlier turn, and a more penetrating
intuition of minds, in warmer climates; not from the loose and common-place
solution of a clearer sky, and a more perpetual sunshine, &c.--which for
aught he knew, might as well rarefy and dilute the faculties of the soul
into nothing, by one extreme,--as they are condensed in colder climates by
the other;--but he traced the affair up to its spring-head;--shewed that,
in warmer climates, nature had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of
the creation;--their pleasures more;--the necessity of their pains less,
insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight,
that the whole organization of the cerebellum was preserved;--nay, he did
not believe, in natural births, that so much as a single thread of the net-
work was broke or displaced,--so that the soul might just act as she liked.
When my father had got so far,--what a blaze of light did the accounts of
the Caesarian section, and of the towering geniuses who had come safe into
the world by it, cast upon this hypothesis? Here you see, he would say,
there was no injury done to the sensorium;--no pressure of the head against
the pelvis;--no propulsion of the cerebrum towards the cerebellum, either
by the os pubis on this side, or os coxygis on that;--and pray, what were
the happy consequences? Why, Sir, your Julius Caesar, who gave the
operation a name;--and your Hermes Trismegistus, who was born so before
ever the operation had a name;--your Scipio Africanus; your Manlius
Torquatus; our Edward the Sixth,--who, had he lived, would have done the
same honour to the hypothesis:--These, and many more who figured high in
the annals of fame,--all came side-way, Sir, into the world.
The incision of the abdomen and uterus ran for six weeks together in my
father's head;--he had read, and was satisfied, that wounds in the
epigastrium, and those in the matrix, were not mortal;--so that the belly
of the mother might be opened extremely well to give a passage to the
child.--He mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother,--merely as a
matter of fact; but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of
it, as much as the operation flattered his hopes,--he thought it as well to
say no more of it,--contenting himself with admiring,--what he thought was
to no purpose to propose.
This was my father Mr. Shandy's hypothesis; concerning which I have only to
add, that my brother Bobby did as great honour to it (whatever he did to
the family) as any one of the great heroes we spoke of: For happening not
only to be christened, as I told you, but to be born too, when my father
was at Epsom,--being moreover my mother's first child,--coming into the
world with his head foremost,--and turning out afterwards a lad of
wonderful slow parts,--my father spelt all these together into his opinion: 
and as he had failed at one end,--he was determined to try the other.
This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood, who are not easily
to be put out of their way,--and was therefore one of my father's great
reasons in favour of a man of science, whom he could better deal with.
Of all men in the world, Dr. Slop was the fittest for my father's purpose;-
-for though this new-invented forceps was the armour he had proved, and
what he maintained to be the safest instrument of deliverance, yet, it
seems, he had scattered a word or two in his book, in favour of the very
thing which ran in my father's fancy;--tho' not with a view to the soul's
good in extracting by the feet, as was my father's system,--but for reasons
merely obstetrical.
This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr. Slop, in the
ensuing discourse, which went a little hard against my uncle Toby.--In what
manner a plain man, with nothing but common sense, could bear up against
two such allies in science,--is hard to conceive.--You may conjecture upon
it, if you please,--and whilst your imagination is in motion, you may
encourage it to go on, and discover by what causes and effects in nature it
could come to pass, that my uncle Toby got his modesty by the wound he
received upon his groin.--You may raise a system to account for the loss of
my nose by marriage-articles,--and shew the world how it could happen, that
I should have the misfortune to be called Tristram, in opposition to my
father's hypothesis, and the wish of the whole family, Godfathers and
Godmothers not excepted.--These, with fifty other points left yet
unravelled, you may endeavour to solve if you have time;--but I tell you
beforehand it will be in vain, for not the sage Alquise, the magician in
Don Belianis of Greece, nor the no less famous Urganda, the sorceress his
wife, (were they alive) could pretend to come within a league of the truth.
The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these matters
till the next year,--when a series of things will be laid open which he
little expects.
Chapter 1.XLV.
--'I wish, Dr. Slop,' quoth my uncle Toby, (repeating his wish for Dr. Slop
a second time, and with a degree of more zeal and earnestness in his manner
of wishing, than he had wished at first (Vide.))--'I wish, Dr. Slop,' quoth
my uncle Toby, 'you had seen what prodigious armies we had in Flanders.'
My uncle Toby's wish did Dr. Slop a disservice which his heart never
intended any man,--Sir, it confounded him--and thereby putting his ideas
first into confusion, and then to flight, he could not rally them again for
the soul of him.
In all disputes,--male or female,--whether for honour, for profit, or for
love,--it makes no difference in the case;--nothing is more dangerous,
Madam, than a wish coming sideways in this unexpected manner upon a man: 
the safest way in general to take off the force of the wish, is for the
party wish'd at, instantly to get upon his legs--and wish the wisher
something in return, of pretty near the same value,--so balancing the
account upon the spot, you stand as you were--nay sometimes gain the
advantage of the attack by it.
This will be fully illustrated to the world in my chapter of wishes.--
Dr. Slop did not understand the nature of this defence;--he was puzzled
with it, and it put an entire stop to the dispute for four minutes and a
half;--five had been fatal to it:--my father saw the danger--the dispute
was one of the most interesting disputes in the world, 'Whether the child
of his prayers and endeavours should be born without a head or with one:'--
he waited to the last moment, to allow Dr. Slop, in whose behalf the wish
was made, his right of returning it; but perceiving, I say, that he was
confounded, and continued looking with that perplexed vacuity of eye which
puzzled souls generally stare with--first in my uncle Toby's face--then in
his--then up--then down--then east--east and by east, and so on,--coasting
it along by the plinth of the wainscot till he had got to the opposite
point of the compass,--and that he had actually begun to count the brass
nails upon the arm of his chair,--my father thought there was no time to be
lost with my uncle Toby, so took up the discourse as follows.
Chapter 1.XLVI.
'--What prodigious armies you had in Flanders!'--
Brother Toby, replied my father, taking his wig from off his head with his
right hand, and with his left pulling out a striped India handkerchief from
his right coat pocket, in order to rub his head, as he argued the point
with my uncle Toby.--
--Now, in this I think my father was much to blame; and I will give you my
reasons for it.
Matters of no more seeming consequence in themselves than, 'Whether my
father should have taken off his wig with his right hand or with his
left,'--have divided the greatest kingdoms, and made the crowns of the
monarchs who governed them, to totter upon their heads.--But need I tell
you, Sir, that the circumstances with which every thing in this world is
begirt, give every thing in this world its size and shape!--and by
tightening it, or relaxing it, this way or that, make the thing to be, what
it is--great--little--good--bad--indifferent or not indifferent, just as
the case happens?
As my father's India handkerchief was in his right coat pocket, he should
by no means have suffered his right hand to have got engaged: on the
contrary, instead of taking off his wig with it, as he did, he ought to
have committed that entirely to the left; and then, when the natural
exigency my father was under of rubbing his head, called out for his
handkerchief, he would have had nothing in the world to have done, but to
have put his right hand into his right coat pocket and taken it out;--which
he might have done without any violence, or the least ungraceful twist in
any one tendon or muscle of his whole body.
In this case, (unless, indeed, my father had been resolved to make a fool
of himself by holding the wig stiff in his left hand--or by making some
nonsensical angle or other at his elbow-joint, or armpit)--his whole
attitude had been easy--natural--unforced: Reynolds himself, as great and
gracefully as he paints, might have painted him as he sat.
Now as my father managed this matter,--consider what a devil of a figure my
father made of himself.
In the latter end of Queen Anne's reign, and in the beginning of the reign
of King George the first--'Coat pockets were cut very low down in the
skirt.'--I need say no more--the father of mischief, had he been hammering
at it a month, could not have contrived a worse fashion for one in my
father's situation.
Chapter 1.XLVII.
It was not an easy matter in any king's reign (unless you were as lean a
subject as myself) to have forced your hand diagonally, quite across your
whole body, so as to gain the bottom of your opposite coat pocket.--In the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, when this happened, it was
extremely difficult; so that when my uncle Toby discovered the transverse
zig-zaggery of my father's approaches towards it, it instantly brought into
his mind those he had done duty in, before the gate of St. Nicolas;--the
idea of which drew off his attention so intirely from the subject in
debate, that he had got his right hand to the bell to ring up Trim to go
and fetch his map of Namur, and his compasses and sector along with it, to
measure the returning angles of the traverses of that attack,--but
particularly of that one, where he received his wound upon his groin.
My father knit his brows, and as he knit them, all the blood in his body
seemed to rush up into his face--my uncle Toby dismounted immediately.
--I did not apprehend your uncle Toby was o'horseback.--
Chapter 1.XLVIII.
A man's body and his mind, with the utmost reverence to both I speak it,
are exactly like a jerkin, and a jerkin's lining;--rumple the one,--you
rumple the other. There is one certain exception however in this case, and
that is, when you are so fortunate a fellow, as to have had your jerkin
made of gum-taffeta, and the body-lining to it of a sarcenet, or thin
persian.
Zeno, Cleanthes, Diogenes Babylonius, Dionysius, Heracleotes, Antipater,
Panaetius, and Possidonius amongst the Greeks;--Cato and Varro and Seneca
amongst the Romans;--Pantenus and Clemens Alexandrinus and Montaigne
amongst the Christians; and a score and a half of good, honest, unthinking
Shandean people as ever lived, whose names I can't recollect,--all
pretended that their jerkins were made after this fashion,--you might have
rumpled and crumpled, and doubled and creased, and fretted and fridged the
outside of them all to pieces;--in short, you might have played the very
devil with them, and at the same time, not one of the insides of them would
have been one button the worse, for all you had done to them.
I believe in my conscience that mine is made up somewhat after this sort:--
for never poor jerkin has been tickled off at such a rate as it has been
these last nine months together,--and yet I declare, the lining to it,--as
far as I am a judge of the matter,--is not a three-penny piece the worse;--
pell-mell, helter-skelter, ding-dong, cut and thrust, back stroke and fore
stroke, side way and long-way, have they been trimming it for me:--had
there been the least gumminess in my lining,--by heaven! it had all of it
long ago been frayed and fretted to a thread.
--You Messrs. the Monthly Reviewers!--how could you cut and slash my jerkin
as you did?--how did you know but you would cut my lining too?
Heartily and from my soul, to the protection of that Being who will injure
none of us, do I recommend you and your affairs,--so God bless you;--only
next month, if any one of you should gnash his teeth, and storm and rage at
me, as some of you did last May (in which I remember the weather was very
hot)--don't be exasperated, if I pass it by again with good temper,--being
determined as long as I live or write) which in my case means the same
thing) never to give the honest gentleman a worse word or a worse wish than
my uncle Toby gave the fly which buzz'd about his nose all dinner-time,--
'Go,--go, poor devil,' quoth he,--'get thee gone,--why should I hurt thee! 
This world is surely wide enough to hold both thee and me.'
Chapter 1.XLIX.
Any man, Madam, reasoning upwards, and observing the prodigious suffusion
of blood in my father's countenance,--by means of which (as all the blood
in his body seemed to rush into his face, as I told you) he must have
reddened, pictorically and scientifically speaking, six whole tints and a
half, if not a full octave above his natural colour:--any man, Madam, but
my uncle Toby, who had observed this, together with the violent knitting of
my father's brows, and the extravagant contortion of his body during the
whole affair,--would have concluded my father in a rage; and taking that
for granted,--had he been a lover of such kind of concord as arises from
two such instruments being put in exact tune,--he would instantly have
skrew'd up his, to the same pitch;--and then the devil and all had broke
loose--the whole piece, Madam, must have been played off like the sixth of
Avison Scarlatti--con furia,--like mad.--Grant me patience!--What has con
furia,--con strepito,--or any other hurly burly whatever to do with
harmony?
Any man, I say, Madam, but my uncle Toby, the benignity of whose heart
interpreted every motion of the body in the kindest sense the motion would
admit of, would have concluded my father angry, and blamed him too. My
uncle Toby blamed nothing but the taylor who cut the pocket-hole;--so
sitting still till my father had got his handkerchief out of it, and
looking all the time up in his face with inexpressible good-will--my
father, at length, went on as follows.
Chapter 1.L.
'What prodigious armies you had in Flanders!'
--Brother Toby, quoth my father, I do believe thee to be as honest a man,
and with as good and as upright a heart as ever God created;--nor is it thy
fault, if all the children which have been, may, can, shall, will, or ought
to be begotten, come with their heads foremost into the world:--but believe
me, dear Toby, the accidents which unavoidably way-lay them, not only in
the article of our begetting 'em--though these, in my opinion, are well
worth considering,--but the dangers and difficulties our children are beset
with, after they are got forth into the world, are enow--little need is
there to expose them to unnecessary ones in their passage to it.--Are these
dangers, quoth my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon my father's knee, and
looking up seriously in his face for an answer,--are these dangers greater
now o'days, brother, than in times past? Brother Toby, answered my father,
if a child was but fairly begot, and born alive, and healthy, and the
mother did well after it,--our forefathers never looked farther.--My uncle
Toby instantly withdrew his hand from off my father's knee, reclined his
body gently back in his chair, raised his head till he could just see the
cornice of the room, and then directing the buccinatory muscles along his
cheeks, and the orbicular muscles around his lips to do their duty--he
whistled Lillabullero.
Chapter 1.LI.
Whilst my uncle Toby was whistling Lillabullero to my father,--Dr. Slop was
stamping, and cursing and damning at Obadiah at a most dreadful rate,--it
would have done your heart good, and cured you, Sir, for ever of the vile
sin of swearing, to have heard him, I am determined therefore to relate the
whole affair to you.
When Dr. Slop's maid delivered the green baize bag with her master's
instruments in it, to Obadiah, she very sensibly exhorted him to put his
head and one arm through the strings, and ride with it slung across his
body: so undoing the bow-knot, to lengthen the strings for him, without
any more ado, she helped him on with it. However, as this, in some
measure, unguarded the mouth of the bag, lest any thing should bolt out in
galloping back, at the speed Obadiah threatened, they consulted to take it
off again: and in the great care and caution of their hearts, they had
taken the two strings and tied them close (pursing up the mouth of the bag
first) with half a dozen hard knots, each of which Obadiah, to make all
safe, had twitched and drawn together with all the strength of his body.
This answered all that Obadiah and the maid intended; but was no remedy
against some evils which neither he or she foresaw. The instruments, it
seems, as tight as the bag was tied above, had so much room to play in it,
towards the bottom (the shape of the bag being conical) that Obadiah could
not make a trot of it, but with such a terrible jingle, what with the tire
tete, forceps, and squirt, as would have been enough, had Hymen been taking
a jaunt that way, to have frightened him out of the country; but when
Obadiah accelerated his motion, and from a plain trot assayed to prick his
coach-horse into a full gallop--by Heaven! Sir, the jingle was incredible.
As Obadiah had a wife and three children--the turpitude of fornication, and
the many other political ill consequences of this jingling, never once
entered his brain,--he had however his objection, which came home to
himself, and weighed with him, as it has oft-times done with the greatest
patriots.--'The poor fellow, Sir, was not able to hear himself whistle.'
Chapter 1.LII.
As Obadiah loved wind-music preferably to all the instrumental music he
carried with him,--he very considerately set his imagination to work, to
contrive and to invent by what means he should put himself in a condition
of enjoying it.
In all distresses (except musical) where small cords are wanted, nothing is
so apt to enter a man's head as his hat-band:--the philosophy of this is so
near the surface--I scorn to enter into it.
As Obadiah's was a mixed case--mark, Sirs,--I say, a mixed case; for it was
obstetrical,--scrip-tical, squirtical, papistical--and as far as the coach-
horse was concerned in it,--caballistical--and only partly musical;--
Obadiah made no scruple of availing himself of the first expedient which
offered; so taking hold of the bag and instruments, and griping them hard
together with one hand, and with the finger and thumb of the other putting
the end of the hat-band betwixt his teeth, and then slipping his hand down
to the middle of it,--he tied and cross-tied them all fast together from
one end to the other (as you would cord a trunk) with such a multiplicity
of round-abouts and intricate cross turns, with a hard knot at every
intersection or point where the strings met,--that Dr. Slop must have had
three fifths of Job's patience at least to have unloosed them.--I think in
my conscience, that had Nature been in one of her nimble moods, and in
humour for such a contest--and she and Dr. Slop both fairly started
together--there is no man living which had seen the bag with all that
Obadiah had done to it,--and known likewise the great speed the Goddess can
make when she thinks proper, who would have had the least doubt remaining
in his mind--which of the two would have carried off the prize. My mother,
Madam, had been delivered sooner than the green bag infallibly--at least by
twenty knots.--Sport of small accidents, Tristram Shandy! that thou art,
and ever will be! had that trial been for thee, and it was fifty to one but
it had,--thy affairs had not been so depress'd--(at least by the depression
of thy nose) as they have been; nor had the fortunes of thy house and the
occasions of making them, which have so often presented themselves in the
course of thy life, to thee, been so often, so vexatiously, so tamely, so
irrecoverably abandoned--as thou hast been forced to leave them;--but 'tis
over,--all but the account of 'em, which cannot be given to the curious
till I am got out into the world.

Chapter 2.I.
Great wits jump: for the moment Dr. Slop cast his eyes upon his bag (which
he had not done till the dispute with my uncle Toby about mid-wifery put
him in mind of it)--the very same thought occurred.--'Tis God's mercy,
quoth he (to himself) that Mrs. Shandy has had so bad a time of it,--else
she might have been brought to bed seven times told, before one half of
these knots could have got untied.--But here you must distinguish--the
thought floated only in Dr. Slop's mind, without sail or ballast to it, as
a simple proposition; millions of which, as your worship knows, are every
day swimming quietly in the middle of the thin juice of a man's
understanding, without being carried backwards or forwards, till some
little gusts of passion or interest drive them to one side.
A sudden trampling in the room above, near my mother's bed, did the
proposition the very service I am speaking of. By all that's unfortunate,
quoth Dr. Slop, unless I make haste, the thing will actually befall me as
it is.
Chapter 2.II.
In the case of knots,--by which, in the first place, I would not be
understood to mean slip-knots--because in the course of my life and
opinions--my opinions concerning them will come in more properly when I
mention the catastrophe of my great uncle Mr. Hammond Shandy,--a little
man,--but of high fancy:--he rushed into the duke of Monmouth's affair:--
nor, secondly, in this place, do I mean that particular species of knots
called bow-knots;--there is so little address, or skill, or patience
required in the unloosing them, that they are below my giving any opinion
at all about them.--But by the knots I am speaking of, may it please your
reverences to believe, that I mean good, honest, devilish tight, hard
knots, made bona fide, as Obadiah made his;--in which there is no quibbling
provision made by the duplication and return of the two ends of the strings
thro' the annulus or noose made by the second implication of them--to get
them slipp'd and undone by.--I hope you apprehend me.
In the case of these knots then, and of the several obstructions, which,
may it please your reverences, such knots cast in our way in getting
through life--every hasty man can whip out his pen-knife and cut through
them.--'Tis wrong. Believe me, Sirs, the most virtuous way, and which both
reason and conscience dictate--is to take our teeth or our fingers to
them.--Dr. Slop had lost his teeth--his favourite instrument, by extracting
in a wrong direction, or by some misapplication of it, unfortunately
slipping, he had formerly, in a hard labour, knock'd out three of the best
of them with the handle of it:--he tried his fingers--alas; the nails of
his fingers and thumbs were cut close.--The duce take it! I can make
nothing of it either way, cried Dr. Slop.--The trampling over head near my
mother's bed-side increased.--Pox take the fellow! I shall never get the
knots untied as long as I live.--My mother gave a groan.--Lend me your
penknife--I must e'en cut the knots at last--pugh!--psha!--Lord! I have
cut my thumb quite across to the very bone--curse the fellow--if there was
not another man-midwife within fifty miles--I am undone for this bout--I
wish the scoundrel hang'd--I wish he was shot--I wish all the devils in
hell had him for a blockhead!--
My father had a great respect for Obadiah, and could not bear to hear him
disposed of in such a manner--he had moreover some little respect for
himself--and could as ill bear with the indignity offered to himself in it.
Had Dr. Slop cut any part about him, but his thumb--my father had pass'd it
by--his prudence had triumphed: as it was, he was determined to have his
revenge.
Small curses, Dr. Slop, upon great occasions, quoth my father (condoling
with him first upon the accident) are but so much waste of our strength and
soul's health to no manner of purpose.--I own it, replied Dr. Slop.--They
are like sparrow-shot, quoth my uncle Toby (suspending his whistling) fired
against a bastion.--They serve, continued my father, to stir the humours--
but carry off none of their acrimony:--for my own part, I seldom swear or
curse at all--I hold it bad--but if I fall into it by surprize, I generally
retain so much presence of mind (right, quoth my uncle Toby) as to make it
answer my purpose--that is, I swear on till I find myself easy. A wife and
a just man however would always endeavour to proportion the vent given to
these humours, not only to the degree of them stirring within himself--but
to the size and ill intent of the offence upon which they are to fall.--
'Injuries come only from the heart,'--quoth my uncle Toby. For this
reason, continued my father, with the most Cervantick gravity, I have the
greatest veneration in the world for that gentleman, who, in distrust of
his own discretion in this point, sat down and composed (that is at his
leisure) fit forms of swearing suitable to all cases, from the lowest to
the highest provocation which could possibly happen to him--which forms
being well considered by him, and such moreover as he could stand to, he
kept them ever by him on the chimney-piece, within his reach, ready for
use.--I never apprehended, replied Dr. Slop, that such a thing was ever
thought of--much less executed. I beg your pardon, answered my father; I
was reading, though not using, one of them to my brother Toby this morning,
whilst he pour'd out the tea--'tis here upon the shelf over my head;--but
if I remember right, 'tis too violent for a cut of the thumb.--Not at all,
quoth Dr. Slop--the devil take the fellow.--Then, answered my father, 'Tis
much at your service, Dr. Slop--on condition you will read it aloud;--so
rising up and reaching down a form of excommunication of the church of
Rome, a copy of which, my father (who was curious in his collections) had
procured out of the leger-book of the church of Rochester, writ by
Ernulphus the bishop--with a most affected seriousness of look and voice,
which might have cajoled Ernulphus himself--he put it into Dr. Slop's
hands.--Dr. Slop wrapt his thumb up in the corner of his handkerchief, and
with a wry face, though without any suspicion, read aloud, as follows--my
uncle Toby whistling Lillabullero as loud as he could all the time.
(As the geniuneness of the consultation of the Sorbonne upon the question
of baptism, was doubted by some, and denied by others--'twas thought proper
to print the original of this excommunication; for the copy of which Mr.
Shandy returns thanks to the chapter clerk of the dean and chapter of
Rochester.)

Chapter 2.IV.
'By the authority of God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and of
the holy canons, and of the undefiled Virgin Mary, mother and patroness of
our Saviour.' I think there is no necessity, quoth Dr. Slop, dropping the
paper down to his knee, and addressing himself to my father--as you have
read it over, Sir, so lately, to read it aloud--and as Captain Shandy seems
to have no great inclination to hear it--I may as well read it to myself. 
That's contrary to treaty, replied my father:--besides, there is something
so whimsical, especially in the latter part of it, I should grieve to lose
the pleasure of a second reading. Dr. Slop did not altogether like it,--
but my uncle Toby offering at that instant to give over whistling, and read
it himself to them;--Dr. Slop thought he might as well read it under the
cover of my uncle Toby's whistling--as suffer my uncle Toby to read it
alone;--so raising up the paper to his face, and holding it quite parallel
to it, in order to hide his chagrin--he read it aloud as follows--my uncle
Toby whistling Lillabullero, though not quite so loud as before.
'By the authority of God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and of
the undefiled Virgin Mary, mother and patroness of our Saviour, and of all
the celestial virtues, angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, powers,
cherubins and seraphins, and of all the holy patriarchs, prophets, and of
all the apostles and evangelists, and of the holy innocents, who in the
sight of the Holy Lamb, are found worthy to sing the new song of the holy
martyrs and holy confessors, and of the holy virgins, and of all the saints
together, with the holy and elect of God,--May he' (Obadiah) 'be damn'd'
(for tying these knots)--'We excommunicate, and anathematize him, and from
the thresholds of the holy church of God Almighty we sequester him, that he
may be tormented, disposed, and delivered over with Dathan and Abiram, and
with those who say unto the Lord God, Depart from us, we desire none of thy
ways. And as fire is quenched with water, so let the light of him be put
out for evermore, unless it shall repent him' (Obadiah, of the knots which
he has tied) 'and make satisfaction' (for them) 'Amen.
'May the Father who created man, curse him.--May the Son who suffered for
us curse him.--May the Holy Ghost, who was given to us in baptism, curse
him' (Obadiah)--'May the holy cross which Christ, for our salvation
triumphing over his enemies, ascended, curse him.
'May the holy and eternal Virgin Mary, mother of God, curse him.--May St.
Michael, the advocate of holy souls, curse him.--May all the angels and
archangels, principalities and powers, and all the heavenly armies, curse
him.' (Our armies swore terribly in Flanders, cried my uncle Toby,--but
nothing to this.--For my own part I could not have a heart to curse my dog
so.)
'May St. John, the Praecursor, and St. John the Baptist, and St. Peter and
St. Paul, and St. Andrew, and all other Christ's apostles, together curse
him. And may the rest of his disciples and four evangelists, who by their
preaching converted the universal world, and may the holy and wonderful
company of martyrs and confessors who by their holy works are found
pleasing to God Almighty, curse him' (Obadiah.)
'May the holy choir of the holy virgins, who for the honour of Christ have
despised the things of the world, damn him--May all the saints, who from
the beginning of the world to everlasting ages are found to be beloved of
God, damn him--May the heavens and earth, and all the holy things remaining
therein, damn him,' (Obadiah) 'or her,' (or whoever else had a hand in
tying these knots.)
'May he (Obadiah) be damn'd wherever he be--whether in the house or the
stables, the garden or the field, or the highway, or in the path, or in the
wood, or in the water, or in the church.--May he be cursed in living, in
dying.' (Here my uncle Toby, taking the advantage of a minim in the second
bar of his tune, kept whistling one continued note to the end of the
sentence.--Dr. Slop, with his division of curses moving under him, like a
running bass all the way.) 'May he be cursed in eating and drinking, in
being hungry, in being thirsty, in fasting, in sleeping, in slumbering, in
walking, in standing, in sitting, in lying, in working, in resting, in
pissing, in shitting, and in blood-letting!
'May he' (Obadiah) 'be cursed in all the faculties of his body!
'May he be cursed inwardly and outwardly!--May he be cursed in the hair of
his head!--May he be cursed in his brains, and in his vertex,' (that is a
sad curse, quoth my father) 'in his temples, in his forehead, in his ears,
in his eye-brows, in his cheeks, in his jaw-bones, in his nostrils, in his
fore-teeth and grinders, in his lips, in his throat, in his shoulders, in
his wrists, in his arms, in his hands, in his fingers!
'May he be damn'd in his mouth, in his breast, in his heart and purtenance,
down to the very stomach!
'May he be cursed in his reins, and in his groin,' (God in heaven forbid!
quoth my uncle Toby) 'in his thighs, in his genitals,' (my father shook his
head) 'and in his hips, and in his knees, his legs, and feet, and toe-
nails!
'May he be cursed in all the joints and articulations of the members, from
the top of his head to the sole of his foot! May there be no soundness in
him!
'May the son of the living God, with all the glory of his Majesty'--(Here
my uncle Toby, throwing back his head, gave a monstrous, long, loud Whew--
w--w--something betwixt the interjectional whistle of Hay-day! and the word
itself.--
--By the golden beard of Jupiter--and of Juno (if her majesty wore one) and
by the beards of the rest of your heathen worships, which by the bye was no
small number, since what with the beards of your celestial gods, and gods
aerial and aquatick--to say nothing of the beards of town-gods and country-
gods, or of the celestial goddesses your wives, or of the infernal
goddesses your whores and concubines (that is in case they wore them)--all
which beards, as Varro tells me, upon his word and honour, when mustered up
together, made no less than thirty thousand effective beards upon the Pagan
establishment;--every beard of which claimed the rights and privileges of
being stroken and sworn by--by all these beards together then--I vow and
protest, that of the two bad cassocks I am worth in the world, I would have
given the better of them, as freely as ever Cid Hamet offered his--to have
stood by, and heard my uncle Toby's accompanyment.
--'curse him!'--continued Dr. Slop,--'and may heaven, with all the powers
which move therein, rise up against him, curse and damn him' (Obadiah)
'unless he repent and make satisfaction! Amen. So be it,--so be it. 
Amen.'
I declare, quoth my uncle Toby, my heart would not let me curse the devil
himself with so much bitterness.--He is the father of curses, replied Dr.
Slop.--So am not I, replied my uncle.--But he is cursed, and damn'd
already, to all eternity, replied Dr. Slop.
I am sorry for it, quoth my uncle Toby.
Dr. Slop drew up his mouth, and was just beginning to return my uncle Toby
the compliment of his Whu--u--u--or interjectional whistle--when the door
hastily opening in the next chapter but one--put an end to the affair.
Chapter 2.V.
Now don't let us give ourselves a parcel of airs, and pretend that the
oaths we make free with in this land of liberty of ours are our own; and
because we have the spirit to swear them,--imagine that we have had the wit
to invent them too.
I'll undertake this moment to prove it to any man in the world, except to a
connoisseur:--though I declare I object only to a connoisseur in swearing,-
-as I would do to a connoisseur in painting, &c. &c. the whole set of 'em
are so hung round and befetish'd with the bobs and trinkets of criticism,--
or to drop my metaphor, which by the bye is a pity--for I have fetch'd it
as far as from the coast of Guiney;--their heads, Sir, are stuck so full of
rules and compasses, and have that eternal propensity to apply them upon
all occasions, that a work of genius had better go to the devil at once,
than stand to be prick'd and tortured to death by 'em.
--And how did Garrick speak the soliloquy last night?--Oh, against all
rule, my lord,--most ungrammatically! betwixt the substantive and the
adjective, which should agree together in number, case, and gender, he made
a breach thus,--stopping, as if the point wanted settling;--and betwixt the
nominative case, which your lordship knows should govern the verb, he
suspended his voice in the epilogue a dozen times three seconds and three
fifths by a stop watch, my lord, each time.--Admirable grammarian!--But in
suspending his voice--was the sense suspended likewise? Did no expression
of attitude or countenance fill up the chasm?--Was the eye silent? Did you
narrowly look?--I look'd only at the stop-watch, my lord.--Excellent
observer!
And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout about?--Oh!
'tis out of all plumb, my lord,--quite an irregular thing!--not one of the
angles at the four corners was a right angle.--I had my rule and compasses,
&c. my lord, in my pocket.--Excellent critick!
--And for the epick poem your lordship bid me look at--upon taking the
length, breadth, height, and depth of it, and trying them at home upon an
exact scale of Bossu's--'tis out, my lord, in every one of its dimensions.-
-Admirable connoisseur!
--And did you step in, to take a look at the grand picture in your way
back?--'Tis a melancholy daub! my lord; not one principle of the pyramid in
any one group!--and what a price!--for there is nothing of the colouring of
Titian--the expression of Rubens--the grace of Raphael--the purity of
Dominichino--the corregiescity of Corregio--the learning of Poussin--the
airs of Guido--the taste of the Carrachis--or the grand contour of Angelo.-
-Grant me patience, just Heaven!--Of all the cants which are canted in this
canting world--though the cant of hypocrites may be the worst--the cant of
criticism is the most tormenting!
I would go fifty miles on foot, for I have not a horse worth riding on, to
kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will give up the reins of
his imagination into his author's hands--be pleased he knows not why, and
cares not wherefore.
Great Apollo! if thou art in a giving humour--give me--I ask no more, but
one stroke of native humour, with a single spark of thy own fire along with
it--and send Mercury, with the rules and compasses, if he can be spared,
with my compliments to--no matter.
Now to any one else I will undertake to prove, that all the oaths and
imprecations which we have been puffing off upon the world for these two
hundred and fifty years last past as originals--except St. Paul's thumb--
God's flesh and God's fish, which were oaths monarchical, and, considering
who made them, not much amiss; and as kings oaths, 'tis not much matter
whether they were fish or flesh;--else I say, there is not an oath, or at
least a curse amongst them, which has not been copied over and over again
out of Ernulphus a thousand times: but, like all other copies, how
infinitely short of the force and spirit of the original!--it is thought to
be no bad oath--and by itself passes very well--'G-d damn you.'--Set it
beside Ernulphus's--'God almighty the Father damn you--God the Son damn
you--God the Holy Ghost damn you'--you see 'tis nothing.--There is an
orientality in his, we cannot rise up to: besides, he is more copious in
his invention--possess'd more of the excellencies of a swearer--had such a
thorough knowledge of the human frame, its membranes, nerves, ligaments,
knittings of the joints, and articulations,--that when Ernulphus cursed--no
part escaped him.--'Tis true there is something of a hardness in his
manner--and, as in Michael Angelo, a want of grace--but then there is such
a greatness of gusto!
My father, who generally look'd upon every thing in a light very different
from all mankind, would, after all, never allow this to be an original.--He
considered rather Ernulphus's anathema, as an institute of swearing, in
which, as he suspected, upon the decline of swearing in some milder
pontificate, Ernulphus, by order of the succeeding pope, had with great
learning and diligence collected together all the laws of it;--for the same
reason that Justinian, in the decline of the empire, had ordered his
chancellor Tribonian to collect the Roman or civil laws all together into
one code or digest--lest, through the rust of time--and the fatality of all
things committed to oral tradition--they should be lost to the world for
ever.
For this reason my father would oft-times affirm, there was not an oath
from the great and tremendous oath of William the conqueror (By the
splendour of God) down to the lowest oath of a scavenger (Damn your eyes)
which was not to be found in Ernulphus.--In short, he would add--I defy a
man to swear out of it.
The hypothesis is, like most of my father's, singular and ingenious too;--
nor have I any objection to it, but that it overturns my own.
Chapter 2.VI.
--Bless my soul!--my poor mistress is ready to faint--and her pains are
gone--and the drops are done--and the bottle of julap is broke--and the
nurse has cut her arm--(and I, my thumb, cried Dr. Slop,) and the child is
where it was, continued Susannah,--and the midwife has fallen backwards
upon the edge of the fender, and bruised her hip as black as your hat.--
I'll look at it, quoth Dr Slop.--There is no need of that, replied
Susannah,--you had better look at my mistress--but the midwife would gladly
first give you an account how things are, so desires you would go up stairs
and speak to her this moment.
Human nature is the same in all professions.
The midwife had just before been put over Dr. Slop's head--He had not
digested it.--No, replied Dr. Slop, 'twould be full as proper if the
midwife came down to me.--I like subordination, quoth my uncle Toby,--and
but for it, after the reduction of Lisle, I know not what might have become
of the garrison of Ghent, in the mutiny for bread, in the year Ten.--Nor,
replied Dr. Slop, (parodying my uncle Toby's hobby-horsical reflection;
though full as hobby-horsical himself)--do I know, Captain Shandy, what
might have become of the garrison above stairs, in the mutiny and confusion
I find all things are in at present, but for the subordination of fingers
and thumbs to. . .--the application of which, Sir, under this accident of
mine, comes in so a propos, that without it, the cut upon my thumb might
have been felt by the Shandy family, as long as the Shandy family had a
name.
Chapter 2.VII.
Let us go back to the. . .--in the last chapter.
It is a singular stroke of eloquence (at least it was so, when eloquence
flourished at Athens and Rome, and would be so now, did orators wear
mantles) not to mention the name of a thing, when you had the thing about
you in petto, ready to produce, pop, in the place you want it. A scar, an
axe, a sword, a pink'd doublet, a rusty helmet, a pound and a half of pot-
ashes in an urn, or a three-halfpenny pickle pot--but above all, a tender
infant royally accoutred.--Tho' if it was too young, and the oration as
long as Tully's second Philippick--it must certainly have beshit the
orator's mantle.--And then again, if too old,--it must have been unwieldly
and incommodious to his action--so as to make him lose by his child almost
as much as he could gain by it.--Otherwise, when a state orator has hit the
precise age to a minute--hid his Bambino in his mantle so cunningly that no
mortal could smell it--and produced it so critically, that no soul could
say, it came in by head and shoulders--Oh Sirs! it has done wonders--It has
open'd the sluices, and turn'd the brains, and shook the principles, and
unhinged the politicks of half a nation.
These feats however are not to be done, except in those states and times, I
say, where orators wore mantles--and pretty large ones too, my brethren,
with some twenty or five-and-twenty yards of good purple, superfine,
marketable cloth in them--with large flowing folds and doubles, and in a
great style of design.--All which plainly shews, may it please your
worships, that the decay of eloquence, and the little good service it does
at present, both within and without doors, is owing to nothing else in the
world, but short coats, and the disuse of trunk-hose.--We can conceal
nothing under ours, Madam, worth shewing.
Chapter 2.VIII.
Dr. Slop was within an ace of being an exception to all this argumentation: 
for happening to have his green baize bag upon his knees, when he began to
parody my uncle Toby--'twas as good as the best mantle in the world to him: 
for which purpose, when he foresaw the sentence would end in his new-
invented forceps, he thrust his hand into the bag in order to have them
ready to clap in, when your reverences took so much notice of the. . .,
which had he managed--my uncle Toby had certainly been overthrown: the
sentence and the argument in that case jumping closely in one point, so
like the two lines which form the salient angle of a ravelin,--Dr. Slop
would never have given them up;--and my uncle Toby would as soon have
thought of flying, as taking them by force: but Dr. Slop fumbled so vilely
in pulling them out, it took off the whole effect, and what was a ten times
worse evil (for they seldom come alone in this life) in pulling out his
forceps, his forceps unfortunately drew out the squirt along with it.
When a proposition can be taken in two senses--'tis a law in disputation,
That the respondent may reply to which of the two he pleases, or finds most
convenient for him.--This threw the advantage of the argument quite on my
uncle Toby's side.--'Good God!' cried my uncle Toby, 'are children brought
into the world with a squirt?'
Chapter 2.IX.
--Upon my honour, Sir, you have tore every bit of skin quite off the back
of both my hands with your forceps, cried my uncle Toby--and you have
crush'd all my knuckles into the bargain with them to a jelly. 'Tis your
own fault, said Dr. Slop--you should have clinch'd your two fists together
into the form of a child's head as I told you, and sat firm.--I did so,
answered my uncle Toby.--Then the points of my forceps have not been
sufficiently arm'd, or the rivet wants closing--or else the cut on my thumb
has made me a little aukward--or possibly--'Tis well, quoth my father,
interrupting the detail of possibilities--that the experiment was not first
made upon my child's head-piece.--It would not have been a cherry-stone the
worse, answered Dr. Slop.--I maintain it, said my uncle Toby, it would have
broke the cerebellum (unless indeed the skull had been as hard as a
granado) and turn'd it all into a perfect posset.--Pshaw! replied Dr. Slop,
a child's head is naturally as soft as the pap of an apple;--the sutures
give way--and besides, I could have extracted by the feet after.--Not you,
said she.--I rather wish you would begin that way, quoth my father.
Pray do, added my uncle Toby.
Chapter 2.X.
--And pray, good woman, after all, will you take upon you to say, it may
not be the child's hip, as well as the child's head?--'Tis most certainly
the head, replied the midwife. Because, continued Dr. Slop (turning to my
father) as positive as these old ladies generally are--'tis a point very
difficult to know--and yet of the greatest consequence to be known;--
because, Sir, if the hip is mistaken for the head--there is a possibility
(if it is a boy) that the forceps. . ..
--What the possibility was, Dr. Slop whispered very low to my father, and
then to my uncle Toby.--There is no such danger, continued he, with the
head.--No, in truth quoth my father--but when your possibility has taken
place at the hip--you may as well take off the head too.
--It is morally impossible the reader should understand this--'tis enough
Dr. Slop understood it;--so taking the green baize bag in his hand, with
the help of Obadiah's pumps, he tripp'd pretty nimbly, for a man of his
size, across the room to the door--and from the door was shewn the way, by
the good old midwife, to my mother's apartments.
Chapter 2.XI.
It is two hours, and ten minutes--and no more--cried my father, looking at
his watch, since Dr. Slop and Obadiah arrived--and I know not how it
happens, Brother Toby--but to my imagination it seems almost an age.
--Here--pray, Sir, take hold of my cap--nay, take the bell along with it,
and my pantoufles too.
Now, Sir, they are all at your service; and I freely make you a present of
'em, on condition you give me all your attention to this chapter.
Though my father said, 'he knew not how it happen'd,'--yet he knew very
well how it happen'd;--and at the instant he spoke it, was pre-determined
in his mind to give my uncle Toby a clear account of the matter by a
metaphysical dissertation upon the subject of duration and its simple
modes, in order to shew my uncle Toby by what mechanism and mensurations in
the brain it came to pass, that the rapid succession of their ideas, and
the eternal scampering of the discourse from one thing to another, since
Dr. Slop had come into the room, had lengthened out so short a period to so
inconceivable an extent.--'I know not how it happens--cried my father,--but
it seems an age.'
--'Tis owing entirely, quoth my uncle Toby, to the succession of our ideas.
My father, who had an itch, in common with all philosophers, of reasoning
upon every thing which happened, and accounting for it too--proposed
infinite pleasure to himself in this, of the succession of ideas, and had
not the least apprehension of having it snatch'd out of his hands by my
uncle Toby, who (honest man!) generally took every thing as it happened;--
and who, of all things in the world, troubled his brain the least with
abstruse thinking;--the ideas of time and space--or how we came by those
ideas--or of what stuff they were made--or whether they were born with us--
or we picked them up afterwards as we went along--or whether we did it in
frocks--or not till we had got into breeches--with a thousand other
inquiries and disputes about Infinity Prescience, Liberty, Necessity, and
so forth, upon whose desperate and unconquerable theories so many fine
heads have been turned and cracked--never did my uncle Toby's the least
injury at all; my father knew it--and was no less surprized than he was
disappointed, with my uncle's fortuitous solution.
Do you understand the theory of that affair? replied my father.
Not I, quoth my uncle.
--But you have some ideas, said my father, of what you talk about?
No more than my horse, replied my uncle Toby.
Gracious heaven! cried my father, looking upwards, and clasping his two
hands together--there is a worth in thy honest ignorance, brother Toby--
'twere almost a pity to exchange it for a knowledge.--But I'll tell thee.--
To understand what time is aright, without which we never can comprehend
infinity, insomuch as one is a portion of the other--we ought seriously to
sit down and consider what idea it is we have of duration, so as to give a
satisfactory account how we came by it.--What is that to any body? quoth my
uncle Toby. (Vide Locke.) For if you will turn your eyes inwards upon
your mind, continued my father, and observe attentively, you will perceive,
brother, that whilst you and I are talking together, and thinking, and
smoking our pipes, or whilst we receive successively ideas in our minds, we
know that we do exist, and so we estimate the existence, or the
continuation of the existence of ourselves, or any thing else, commensurate
to the succession of any ideas in our minds, the duration of ourselves, or
any such other thing co-existing with our thinking--and so according to
that preconceived--You puzzle me to death, cried my uncle Toby.
--'Tis owing to this, replied my father, that in our computations of time,
we are so used to minutes, hours, weeks, and months--and of clocks (I wish
there was not a clock in the kingdom) to measure out their several portions
to us, and to those who belong to us--that 'twill be well, if in time to
come, the succession of our ideas be of any use or service to us at all.
Now, whether we observe it or no, continued my father, in every sound man's
head, there is a regular succession of ideas of one sort or other, which
follow each other in train just like--A train of artillery? said my uncle
Toby--A train of a fiddle-stick!--quoth my father--which follow and succeed
one another in our minds at certain distances, just like the images in the
inside of a lanthorn turned round by the heat of a candle.--I declare,
quoth my uncle Toby, mine are more like a smoke-jack,--Then, brother Toby,
I have nothing more to say to you upon that subject, said my father.
Chapter 2.XII.
--What a conjuncture was here lost!--My father in one of his best
explanatory moods--in eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into the very
regions, where clouds and thick darkness would soon have encompassed it
about;--my uncle Toby in one of the finest dispositions for it in the
world;--his head like a smoke-jack;--the funnel unswept, and the ideas
whirling round and round about in it, all obfuscated and darkened over with
fuliginous matter!--By the tomb-stone of Lucian--if it is in being--if not,
why then by his ashes! by the ashes of my dear Rabelais, and dearer
Cervantes!--my father and my uncle Toby's discourse upon Time and Eternity-
-was a discourse devoutly to be wished for! and the petulancy of my
father's humour, in putting a stop to it as he did, was a robbery of the
Ontologic Treasury of such a jewel, as no coalition of great occasions and
great men are ever likely to restore to it again.
Chapter 2.XIII.
Tho' my father persisted in not going on with the discourse--yet he could
not get my uncle Toby's smoke-jack out of his head--piqued as he was at
first with it;--there was something in the comparison at the bottom, which
hit his fancy; for which purpose, resting his elbow upon the table, and
reclining the right side of his head upon the palm of his hand--but looking
first stedfastly in the fire--he began to commune with himself, and
philosophize about it: but his spirits being wore out with the fatigues of
investigating new tracts, and the constant exertion of his faculties upon
that variety of subjects which had taken their turn in the discourse--the
idea of the smoke jack soon turned all his ideas upside down--so that he
fell asleep almost before he knew what he was about.
As for my uncle Toby, his smoke-jack had not made a dozen revolutions,
before he fell asleep also.--Peace be with them both!--Dr. Slop is engaged
with the midwife and my mother above stairs.--Trim is busy in turning an
old pair of jack-boots into a couple of mortars, to be employed in the
siege of Messina next summer--and is this instant boring the touch-holes
with the point of a hot poker.--All my heroes are off my hands;--'tis the
first time I have had a moment to spare--and I'll make use of it, and write
my preface.
The Author's Preface
No, I'll not say a word about it--here it is;--in publishing it--I have
appealed to the world--and to the world I leave it;--it must speak for
itself.
All I know of the matter is--when I sat down, my intent was to write a good
book; and as far as the tenuity of my understanding would hold out--a wise,
aye, and a discreet--taking care only, as I went along, to put into it all
the wit and the judgment (be it more or less) which the great Author and
Bestower of them had thought fit originally to give me--so that, as your
worships see--'tis just as God pleases.
Now, Agalastes (speaking dispraisingly) sayeth, That there may be some wit
in it, for aught he knows--but no judgment at all. And Triptolemus and
Phutatorius agreeing thereto, ask, How is it possible there should? for
that wit and judgment in this world never go together; inasmuch as they are
two operations differing from each other as wide as east from west--So,
says Locke--so are farting and hickuping, say I. But in answer to this,
Didius the great church lawyer, in his code de fartendi et illustrandi
fallaciis, doth maintain and make fully appear, That an illustration is no
argument--nor do I maintain the wiping of a looking-glass clean to be a
syllogism;--but you all, may it please your worships, see the better for
it--so that the main good these things do is only to clarify the
understanding, previous to the application of the argument itself, in order
to free it from any little motes, or specks of opacular matter, which, if
left swimming therein, might hinder a conception and spoil all.
Now, my dear anti-Shandeans, and thrice able criticks, and fellow-labourers
(for to you I write this Preface)--and to you, most subtle statesmen and
discreet doctors (do--pull off your beards) renowned for gravity and
wisdom;--Monopolus, my politician--Didius, my counsel; Kysarcius, my
friend;--Phutatorius, my guide;--Gastripheres, the preserver of my life;
Somnolentius, the balm and repose of it--not forgetting all others, as well
sleeping as waking, ecclesiastical as civil, whom for brevity, but out of
no resentment to you, I lump all together.--Believe me, right worthy,
My most zealous wish and fervent prayer in your behalf, and in my own too,
in case the thing is not done already for us--is, that the great gifts and
endowments both of wit and judgment, with every thing which usually goes
along with them--such as memory, fancy, genius, eloquence, quick parts, and
what not, may this precious moment, without stint or measure, let or
hindrance, be poured down warm as each of us could bear it--scum and
sediment and all (for I would not have a drop lost) into the several
receptacles, cells, cellules, domiciles, dormitories, refectories, and
spare places of our brains--in such sort, that they might continue to be
injected and tunn'd into, according to the true intent and meaning of my
wish, until every vessel of them, both great and small, be so replenish'd,
saturated, and filled up therewith, that no more, would it save a man's
life, could possibly be got either in or out.
Bless us!--what noble work we should make!--how should I tickle it off!--
and what spirits should I find myself in, to be writing away for such
readers!--and you--just heaven!--with what raptures would you sit and read-
-but oh!--'tis too much--I am sick--I faint away deliciously at the
thoughts of it--'tis more than nature can bear!--lay hold of me--I am
giddy--I am stone blind--I'm dying--I am gone.--Help! Help! Help!--But
hold--I grow something better again, for I am beginning to foresee, when
this is over, that as we shall all of us continue to be great wits--we
should never agree amongst ourselves, one day to an end:--there would be so
much satire and sarcasm--scoffing and flouting, with raillying and
reparteeing of it--thrusting and parrying in one corner or another--there
would be nothing but mischief among us--Chaste stars! what biting and
scratching, and what a racket and a clatter we should make, what with
breaking of heads, rapping of knuckles, and hitting of sore places--there
would be no such thing as living for us.
But then again, as we should all of us be men of great judgment, we should
make up matters as fast as ever they went wrong; and though we should
abominate each other ten times worse than so many devils or devilesses, we
should nevertheless, my dear creatures, be all courtesy and kindness, milk
and honey--'twould be a second land of promise--a paradise upon earth, if
there was such a thing to be had--so that upon the whole we should have
done well enough.
All I fret and fume at, and what most distresses my invention at present,
is how to bring the point itself to bear; for as your worships well know,
that of these heavenly emanations of wit and judgment, which I have so
bountifully wished both for your worships and myself--there is but a
certain quantum stored up for us all, for the use and behoof of the whole
race of mankind; and such small modicums of 'em are only sent forth into
this wide world, circulating here and there in one bye corner or another--
and in such narrow streams, and at such prodigious intervals from each
other, that one would wonder how it holds out, or could be sufficient for
the wants and emergencies of so many great estates, and populous empires.
Indeed there is one thing to be considered, that in Nova Zembla, North
Lapland, and in all those cold and dreary tracks of the globe, which lie
more directly under the arctick and antartick circles, where the whole
province of a man's concernments lies for near nine months together within
the narrow compass of his cave--where the spirits are compressed almost to
nothing--and where the passions of a man, with every thing which belongs to
them, are as frigid as the zone itself--there the least quantity of
judgment imaginable does the business--and of wit--there is a total and an
absolute saving--for as not one spark is wanted--so not one spark is given. 
Angels and ministers of grace defend us! what a dismal thing would it have
been to have governed a kingdom, to have fought a battle, or made a treaty,
or run a match, or wrote a book, or got a child, or held a provincial
chapter there, with so plentiful a lack of wit and judgment about us! For
mercy's sake, let us think no more about it, but travel on as fast as we
can southwards into Norway--crossing over Swedeland, if you please, through
the small triangular province of Angermania to the lake of Bothmia;
coasting along it through east and west Bothnia, down to Carelia, and so
on, through all those states and provinces which border upon the far side
of the Gulf of Finland, and the north-east of the Baltick, up to
Petersbourg, and just stepping into Ingria;--then stretching over directly
from thence through the north parts of the Russian empire--leaving Siberia
a little upon the left hand, till we got into the very heart of Russian and
Asiatick Tartary.
Now through this long tour which I have led you, you observe the good
people are better off by far, than in the polar countries which we have
just left:--for if you hold your hand over your eyes, and look very
attentively, you may perceive some small glimmerings (as it were) of wit,
with a comfortable provision of good plain houshold judgment, which, taking
the quality and quantity of it together, they make a very good shift with--
and had they more of either the one or the other, it would destroy the
proper balance betwixt them, and I am satisfied moreover they would want
occasions to put them to use.
Now, Sir, if I conduct you home again into this warmer and more luxuriant
island, where you perceive the spring-tide of our blood and humours runs
high--where we have more ambition, and pride, and envy, and lechery, and
other whoreson passions upon our hands to govern and subject to reason--the
height of our wit, and the depth of our judgment, you see, are exactly
proportioned to the length and breadth of our necessities--and accordingly
we have them sent down amongst us in such a flowing kind of decent and
creditable plenty, that no one thinks he has any cause to complain.
It must however be confessed on this head, that, as our air blows hot and
cold--wet and dry, ten times in a day, we have them in no regular and
settled way;--so that sometimes for near half a century together, there
shall be very little wit or judgment either to be seen or heard of amongst
us:--the small channels of them shall seem quite dried up--then all of a
sudden the sluices shall break out, and take a fit of running again like
fury--you would think they would never stop:--and then it is, that in
writing, and fighting, and twenty other gallant things, we drive all the
world before us.
It is by these observations, and a wary reasoning by analogy in that kind
of argumentative process, which Suidas calls dialectick induction--that I
draw and set up this position as most true and veritable;
That of these two luminaries so much of their irradiations are suffered
from time to time to shine down upon us, as he, whose infinite wisdom which
dispenses every thing in exact weight and measure, knows will just serve to
light us on our way in this night of our obscurity; so that your reverences
and worships now find out, nor is it a moment longer in my power to conceal
it from you, That the fervent wish in your behalf with which I set out, was
no more than the first insinuating How d'ye of a caressing prefacer,
stifling his reader, as a lover sometimes does a coy mistress, into
silence. For alas! could this effusion of light have been as easily
procured, as the exordium wished it--I tremble to think how many thousands
for it, of benighted travellers (in the learned sciences at least) must
have groped and blundered on in the dark, all the nights of their lives--
running their heads against posts, and knocking out their brains without
ever getting to their journies end;--some falling with their noses
perpendicularly into sinks--others horizontally with their tails into
kennels. Here one half of a learned profession tilting full but against
the other half of it, and then tumbling and rolling one over the other in
the dirt like hogs.--Here the brethren of another profession, who should
have run in opposition to each other, flying on the contrary like a flock
of wild geese, all in a row the same way.--What confusion!--what mistakes!-
-fiddlers and painters judging by their eyes and ears--admirable!--trusting
to the passions excited--in an air sung, or a story painted to the heart--
instead of measuring them by a quadrant.
In the fore-ground of this picture, a statesman turning the political
wheel, like a brute, the wrong way round--against the stream of corruption-
-by Heaven!--instead of with it.
In this corner, a son of the divine Esculapius, writing a book against
predestination; perhaps worse--feeling his patient's pulse, instead of his
apothecary's--a brother of the Faculty in the back-ground upon his knees in
tears--drawing the curtains of a mangled victim to beg his forgiveness;--
offering a fee--instead of taking one.
In that spacious Hall, a coalition of the gown, from all the bars of it,
driving a damn'd, dirty, vexatious cause before them, with all their might
and main, the wrong way!--kicking it out of the great doors, instead of,
in--and with such fury in their looks, and such a degree of inveteracy in
their manner of kicking it, as if the laws had been originally made for the
peace and preservation of mankind:--perhaps a more enormous mistake
committed by them still--a litigated point fairly hung up;--for instance,
Whether John o'Nokes his nose could stand in Tom o'Stiles his face, without
a trespass, or not--rashly determined by them in five-and-twenty minutes,
which, with the cautious pros and cons required in so intricate a
proceeding, might have taken up as many months--and if carried on upon a
military plan, as your honours know an Action should be, with all the
stratagems practicable therein,--such as feints,--forced marches,--
surprizes--ambuscades--mask-batteries, and a thousand other strokes of
generalship, which consist in catching at all advantages on both sides--
might reasonably have lasted them as many years, finding food and raiment
all that term for a centumvirate of the profession.
As for the Clergy--No--if I say a word against them, I'll be shot.--I have
no desire; and besides, if I had--I durst not for my soul touch upon the
subject--with such weak nerves and spirits, and in the condition I am in at
present, 'twould be as much as my life was worth, to deject and contrist
myself with so bad and melancholy an account--and therefore 'tis safer to
draw a curtain across, and hasten from it, as fast as I can, to the main
and principal point I have undertaken to clear up--and that is, How it
comes to pass, that your men of least wit are reported to be men of most
judgment.--But mark--I say, reported to be--for it is no more, my dear
Sirs, than a report, and which, like twenty others taken up every day upon
trust, I maintain to be a vile and a malicious report into the bargain.
This by the help of the observation already premised, and I hope already
weighed and perpended by your reverences and worships, I shall forthwith
make appear.
I hate set dissertations--and above all things in the world, 'tis one of
the silliest things in one of them, to darken your hypothesis by placing a
number of tall, opake words, one before another, in a right line, betwixt
your own and your reader's conception--when in all likelihood, if you had
looked about, you might have seen something standing, or hanging up, which
would have cleared the point at once--'for what hindrance, hurt, or harm
doth the laudable desire of knowledge bring to any man, if even from a sot,
a pot, a fool, a stool, a winter-mittain, a truckle for a pully, the lid of
a goldsmith's crucible, an oil bottle, an old slipper, or a cane chair?'--I
am this moment sitting upon one. Will you give me leave to illustrate this
affair of wit and judgment, by the two knobs on the top of the back of it?-
-they are fastened on, you see, with two pegs stuck slightly into two
gimlet-holes, and will place what I have to say in so clear a light, as to
let you see through the drift and meaning of my whole preface, as plainly
as if every point and particle of it was made up of sun-beams.
I enter now directly upon the point.
--Here stands wit--and there stands judgment, close beside it, just like
the two knobs I'm speaking of, upon the back of this self-same chair on
which I am sitting.
--You see, they are the highest and most ornamental parts of its frame--as
wit and judgment are of ours--and like them too, indubitably both made and
fitted to go together, in order, as we say in all such cases of duplicated
embellishments--to answer one another.
Now for the sake of an experiment, and for the clearer illustrating this
matter--let us for a moment take off one of these two curious ornaments (I
care not which) from the point or pinnacle of the chair it now stands on--
nay, don't laugh at it,--but did you ever see, in the whole course of your
lives, such a ridiculous business as this has made of it?--Why, 'tis as
miserable a sight as a sow with one ear; and there is just as much sense
and symmetry in the one as in the other:--do--pray, get off your seats only
to take a view of it,--Now would any man who valued his character a straw,
have turned a piece of work out of his hand in such a condition?--nay, lay
your hands upon your hearts, and answer this plain question, Whether this
one single knob, which now stands here like a blockhead by itself, can
serve any purpose upon earth, but to put one in mind of the want of the
other?--and let me farther ask, in case the chair was your own, if you
would not in your consciences think, rather than be as it is, that it would
be ten times better without any knob at all?
Now these two knobs--or top ornaments of the mind of man, which crown the
whole entablature--being, as I said, wit and judgment, which of all others,
as I have proved it, are the most needful--the most priz'd--the most
calamitous to be without, and consequently the hardest to come at--for all
these reasons put together, there is not a mortal among us, so destitute of
a love of good fame or feeding--or so ignorant of what will do him good
therein--who does not wish and stedfastly resolve in his own mind, to be,
or to be thought at least, master of the one or the other, and indeed of
both of them, if the thing seems any way feasible, or likely to be brought
to pass.
Now your graver gentry having little or no kind of chance in aiming at the
one--unless they laid hold of the other,--pray what do you think would
become of them?--Why, Sirs, in spite of all their gravities, they must e'en
have been contented to have gone with their insides naked--this was not to
be borne, but by an effort of philosophy not to be supposed in the case we
are upon--so that no one could well have been angry with them, had they
been satisfied with what little they could have snatched up and secreted
under their cloaks and great perriwigs, had they not raised a hue and cry
at the same time against the lawful owners.
I need not tell your worships, that this was done with so much cunning and
artifice--that the great Locke, who was seldom outwitted by false sounds--
was nevertheless bubbled here. The cry, it seems, was so deep and solemn a
one, and what with the help of great wigs, grave faces, and other
implements of deceit, was rendered so general a one against the poor wits
in this matter, that the philosopher himself was deceived by it--it was his
glory to free the world from the lumber of a thousand vulgar errors;--but
this was not of the number; so that instead of sitting down coolly, as such
a philosopher should have done, to have examined the matter of fact before
he philosophised upon it--on the contrary he took the fact for granted, and
so joined in with the cry, and halloo'd it as boisterously as the rest.
This has been made the Magna Charta of stupidity ever since--but your
reverences plainly see, it has been obtained in such a manner, that the
title to it is not worth a groat:--which by-the-bye is one of the many and
vile impositions which gravity and grave folks have to answer for
hereafter.
As for great wigs, upon which I may be thought to have spoken my mind too
freely--I beg leave to qualify whatever has been unguardedly said to their
dispraise or prejudice, by one general declaration--That I have no
abhorrence whatever, nor do I detest and abjure either great wigs or long
beards, any farther than when I see they are bespoke and let grow on
purpose to carry on this self-same imposture--for any purpose--peace be
with them!--> mark only--I write not for them.
Chapter 2.XIV.
Every day for at least ten years together did my father resolve to have it
mended--'tis not mended yet;--no family but ours would have borne with it
an hour--and what is most astonishing, there was not a subject in the world
upon which my father was so eloquent, as upon that of door-hinges.--And yet
at the same time, he was certainly one of the greatest bubbles to them, I
think, that history can produce: his rhetorick and conduct were at
perpetual handy-cuffs.--Never did the parlour-door open--but his philosophy
or his principles fell a victim to it;--three drops of oil with a feather,
and a smart stroke of a hammer, had saved his honour for ever.
--Inconsistent soul that man is!--languishing under wounds, which he has
the power to heal!--his whole life a contradiction to his knowledge!--his
reason, that precious gift of God to him--(instead of pouring in oil)
serving but to sharpen his sensibilities--to multiply his pains, and render
him more melancholy and uneasy under them!--Poor unhappy creature, that he
should do so!--Are not the necessary causes of misery in this life enow,
but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of sorrow;--struggle against
evils which cannot be avoided, and submit to others, which a tenth part of
the trouble they create him would remove from his heart for ever?
By all that is good and virtuous, if there are three drops of oil to be
got, and a hammer to be found within ten miles of Shandy Hall--the parlour
door hinge shall be mended this reign.
Chapter 2.XV.
When Corporal Trim had brought his two mortars to bear, he was delighted
with his handy-work above measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would be
to his master to see them, he was not able to resist the desire he had of
carrying them directly into his parlour.
Now next to the moral lesson I had in view in mentioning the affair of
hinges, I had a speculative consideration arising out of it, and it is
this.
Had the parlour door opened and turn'd upon its hinges, as a door should
do--
Or for example, as cleverly as our government has been turning upon its
hinges--(that is, in case things have all along gone well with your
worship,--otherwise I give up my simile)--in this case, I say, there had
been no danger either to master or man, in corporal Trim's peeping in: the
moment he had beheld my father and my uncle Toby fast asleep--the
respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent as
death, and left them both in their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy as he had
found them: but the thing was, morally speaking, so very impracticable,
that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered to be out of
order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father submitted to upon its
account--this was one; that he never folded his arms to take his nap after
dinner, but the thoughts of being unavoidably awakened by the first person
who should open the door, was always uppermost in his imagination, and so
incessantly stepp'd in betwixt him and the first balmy presage of his
repose, as to rob him, as he often declared, of the whole sweets of it.
'When things move upon bad hinges, an' please your lordships, how can it be
otherwise?'
Pray what's the matter? Who is there? cried my father, waking, the moment
the door began to creak.--I wish the smith would give a peep at that
confounded hinge.--'Tis nothing, an please your honour, said Trim, but two
mortars I am bringing in.--They shan't make a clatter with them here, cried
my father hastily.--If Dr. Slop has any drugs to pound, let him do it in
the kitchen.--May it please your honour, cried Trim, they are two mortar-
pieces for a siege next summer, which I have been making out of a pair of
jack-boots, which Obadiah told me your honour had left off wearing.--By
Heaven! cried my father, springing out of his chair, as he swore--I have
not one appointment belonging to me, which I set so much store by as I do
by these jack-boots--they were our great grandfather's brother Toby--they
were hereditary. Then I fear, quoth my uncle Toby, Trim has cut off the
entail.--I have only cut off the tops, an' please your honour, cried Trim--
I hate perpetuities as much as any man alive, cried my father--but these
jack-boots, continued he (smiling, though very angry at the same time) have
been in the family, brother, ever since the civil wars;--Sir Roger Shandy
wore them at the battle of Marston-Moor.--I declare I would not have taken
ten pounds for them.--I'll pay you the money, brother Shandy, quoth my
uncle Toby, looking at the two mortars with infinite pleasure, and putting
his hand into his breeches pocket as he viewed them--I'll pay you the ten
pounds this moment with all my heart and soul.--
Brother Toby, replied my father, altering his tone, you care not what money
you dissipate and throw away, provided, continued he, 'tis but upon a
Siege.--Have I not one hundred and twenty pounds a year, besides my half
pay? cried my uncle Toby.--What is that--replied my father hastily--to ten
pounds for a pair of jack-boots?--twelve guineas for your pontoons?--half
as much for your Dutch draw-bridge?--to say nothing of the train of little
brass artillery you bespoke last week, with twenty other preparations for
the siege of Messina: believe me, dear brother Toby, continued my father,
taking him kindly by the hand--these military operations of yours are above
your strength;--you mean well brother--but they carry you into greater
expences than you were first aware of;--and take my word, dear Toby, they
will in the end quite ruin your fortune, and make a beggar of you.--What
signifies it if they do, brother, replied my uncle Toby, so long as we know
'tis for the good of the nation?--
My father could not help smiling for his soul--his anger at the worst was
never more than a spark;--and the zeal and simplicity of Trim--and the
generous (though hobby-horsical) gallantry of my uncle Toby, brought him
into perfect good humour with them in an instant.
Generous souls!--God prosper you both, and your mortar-pieces too! quoth my
father to himself.
Chapter 2.XVI.
All is quiet and hush, cried my father, at least above stairs--I hear not
one foot stirring.--Prithee Trim, who's in the kitchen? There is no one
soul in the kitchen, answered Trim, making a low bow as he spoke, except
Dr. Slop.--Confusion! cried my father (getting upon his legs a second
time)--not one single thing has gone right this day! had I faith in
astrology, brother, (which, by the bye, my father had) I would have sworn
some retrograde planet was hanging over this unfortunate house of mine, and
turning every individual thing in it out of its place.--Why, I thought Dr.
Slop had been above stairs with my wife, and so said you.--What can the
fellow be puzzling about in the kitchen!--He is busy, an' please your
honour, replied Trim, in making a bridge.--'Tis very obliging in him, quoth
my uncle Toby:--pray, give my humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell
him I thank him heartily.
You must know, my uncle Toby mistook the bridge--as widely as my father
mistook the mortars:--but to understand how my uncle Toby could mistake the
bridge--I fear I must give you an exact account of the road which led to
it;--or to drop my metaphor (for there is nothing more dishonest in an
historian than the use of one)--in order to conceive the probability of
this error in my uncle Toby aright, I must give you some account of an
adventure of Trim's, though much against my will, I say much against my
will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly out of its place
here; for by right it should come in, either amongst the anecdotes of my
uncle Toby's amours with widow Wadman, in which corporal Trim was no mean
actor--or else in the middle of his and my uncle Toby's campaigns on the
bowling-green--for it will do very well in either place;--but then if I
reserve it for either of those parts of my story--I ruin the story I'm
upon;--and if I tell it here--I anticipate matters, and ruin it there.
--What would your worship have me to do in this case?
--Tell it, Mr. Shandy, by all means.--You are a fool, Tristram, if you do.
O ye powers! (for powers ye are, and great ones too)--which enable mortal
man to tell a story worth the hearing--that kindly shew him, where he is to
begin it--and where he is to end it--what he is to put into it--and what he
is to leave out--how much of it he is to cast into a shade--and whereabouts
he is to throw his light!--Ye, who preside over this vast empire of
biographical freebooters, and see how many scrapes and plunges your
subjects hourly fall into;--will you do one thing?
I beg and beseech you (in case you will do nothing better for us) that
wherever in any part of your dominions it so falls out, that three several
roads meet in one point, as they have done just here--that at least you set
up a guide-post in the centre of them, in mere charity, to direct an
uncertain devil which of the three he is to take. 
Chapter 2.XVII.
Tho' the shock my uncle Toby received the year after the demolition of
Dunkirk, in his affair with widow Wadman, had fixed him in a resolution
never more to think of the sex--or of aught which belonged to it;--yet
corporal Trim had made no such bargain with himself. Indeed in my uncle
Toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of
circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair and
strong citadel.--In Trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing in the
world, but of him and Bridget in the kitchen;--though in truth, the love
and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he of imitating
him in all he did, that had my uncle Toby employed his time and genius in
tagging of points--I am persuaded the honest corporal would have laid down
his arms, and followed his example with pleasure. When therefore my uncle
Toby sat down before the mistress--corporal Trim incontinently took ground
before the maid.
Now, my dear friend Garrick, whom I have so much cause to esteem and
honour--(why, or wherefore, 'tis no matter)--can it escape your
penetration--I defy it--that so many play-wrights, and opificers of chit-
chat have ever since been working upon Trim's and my uncle Toby's pattern.-
-I care not what Aristotle, or Pacuvius, or Bossu, or Ricaboni say--(though
I never read one of them)--there is not a greater difference between a
single-horse chair and madam Pompadour's vis-a-vis; than betwixt a single
amour, and an amour thus nobly doubled, and going upon all four, prancing
throughout a grand drama--Sir, a simple, single, silly affair of that kind-
-is quite lost in five acts--but that is neither here nor there.
After a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my
uncle Toby's quarter, a most minute account of every particular of which
shall be given in its proper place, my uncle Toby, honest man! found it
necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat indignantly.
Corporal Trim, as I said, had made no such bargain either with himself--or
with any one else--the fidelity however of his heart not suffering him to
go into a house which his master had forsaken with disgust--he contented
himself with turning his part of the siege into a blockade;--that is, he
kept others off;--for though he never after went to the house, yet he never
met Bridget in the village, but he would either nod or wink, or smile, or
look kindly at her--or (as circumstances directed) he would shake her by
the hand--or ask her lovingly how she did--or would give her a ribbon--and
now-and-then, though never but when it could be done with decorum, would
give Bridget a. . .--
Precisely in this situation, did these things stand for five years; that is
from the demolition of Dunkirk in the year 13, to the latter end of my
uncle Toby's campaign in the year 18, which was about six or seven weeks
before the time I'm speaking of.--When Trim, as his custom was, after he
had put my uncle Toby to bed, going down one moon-shiny night to see that
every thing was right at his fortifications--in the lane separated from the
bowling-green with flowering shrubs and holly--he espied his Bridget.
As the corporal thought there was nothing in the world so well worth
shewing as the glorious works which he and my uncle Toby had made, Trim
courteously and gallantly took her by the hand, and led her in: this was
not done so privately, but that the foul-mouth'd trumpet of Fame carried it
from ear to ear, till at length it reach'd my father's, with this untoward
circumstance along with it, that my uncle Toby's curious draw-bridge,
constructed and painted after the Dutch fashion, and which went quite
across the ditch--was broke down, and somehow or other crushed all to
pieces that very night.
My father, as you have observed, had no great esteem for my uncle Toby's
hobby-horse; he thought it the most ridiculous horse that ever gentleman
mounted; and indeed unless my uncle Toby vexed him about it, could never
think of it once, without smiling at it--so that it could never get lame or
happen any mischance, but it tickled my father's imagination beyond
measure; but this being an accident much more to his humour than any one
which had yet befall'n it, it proved an inexhaustible fund of entertainment
to him--Well--but dear Toby! my father would say, do tell me seriously how
this affair of the bridge happened.--How can you teaze me so much about it?
my uncle Toby would reply--I have told it you twenty times, word for word
as Trim told it me.--Prithee, how was it then, corporal? my father would
cry, turning to Trim.--It was a mere misfortune, an' please your honour;--I
was shewing Mrs. Bridget our fortifications, and in going too near the edge
of the fosse, I unfortunately slipp'd in--Very well, Trim! my father would
cry--(smiling mysteriously, and giving a nod--but without interrupting
him)--and being link'd fast, an' please your honour, arm in arm with Mrs.
Bridget, I dragg'd her after me, by means of which she fell backwards soss
against the bridge--and Trim's foot (my uncle Toby would cry, taking the
story out of his mouth) getting into the cuvette, he tumbled full against
the bridge too.--It was a thousand to one, my uncle Toby would add, that
the poor fellow did not break his leg.--Ay truly, my father would say--a
limb is soon broke, brother Toby, in such encounters.--And so, an' please
your honour, the bridge, which your honour knows was a very slight one, was
broke down betwixt us, and splintered all to pieces.
At other times, but especially when my uncle Toby was so unfortunate as to
say a syllable about cannons, bombs, or petards--my father would exhaust
all the stores of his eloquence (which indeed were very great) in a
panegyric upon the Battering-Rams of the ancients--the Vinea which
Alexander made use of at the siege of Troy.--He would tell my uncle Toby of
the Catapultae of the Syrians, which threw such monstrous stones so many
hundred feet, and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very foundation:-
-he would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of the Ballista which
Marcellinus makes so much rout about!--the terrible effects of the
Pyraboli, which cast fire;--the danger of the Terebra and Scorpio, which
cast javelins.--But what are these, would he say, to the destructive
machinery of corporal Trim?--Believe me, brother Toby, no bridge, or
bastion, or sally-port, that ever was constructed in this world, can hold
out against such artillery.
My uncle Toby would never attempt any defence against the force of this
ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe; in
doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper, that it
set my father, who was a little phthisical, into a suffocating fit of
violent coughing: my uncle Toby leap'd up without feeling the pain upon
his groin--and, with infinite pity, stood beside his brother's chair,
tapping his back with one hand, and holding his head with the other, and
from time to time wiping his eyes with a clean cambrick handkerchief, which
he pulled out of his pocket.--The affectionate and endearing manner in
which my uncle Toby did these little offices--cut my father thro' his
reins, for the pain he had just been giving him.--May my brains be knock'd
out with a battering-ram or a catapulta, I care not which, quoth my father
to himself--if ever I insult this worthy soul more!
Chapter 2.XVIII.
The draw-bridge being held irreparable, Trim was ordered directly to set
about another--but not upon the same model: for cardinal Alberoni's
intrigues at that time being discovered, and my uncle Toby rightly
foreseeing that a flame would inevitably break out betwixt Spain and the
Empire, and that the operations of the ensuing campaign must in all
likelihood be either in Naples or Sicily--he determined upon an Italian
bridge--(my uncle Toby, by-the-bye, was not far out of his conjectures)--
but my father, who was infinitely the better politician, and took the lead
as far of my uncle Toby in the cabinet, as my uncle Toby took it of him in
the field--convinced him, that if the king of Spain and the Emperor went
together by the ears, England and France and Holland must, by force of
their pre-engagements, all enter the lists too;--and if so, he would say,
the combatants, brother Toby, as sure as we are alive, will fall to it
again, pell-mell, upon the old prize-fighting stage of Flanders;--then what
will you do with your Italian bridge?
--We will go on with it then upon the old model, cried my uncle Toby.
When corporal Trim had about half finished it in that style--my uncle Toby
found out a capital defect in it, which he had never thoroughly considered
before. It turned, it seems, upon hinges at both ends of it, opening in
the middle, one half of which turning to one side of the fosse, and the
other to the other; the advantage of which was this, that by dividing the
weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it impowered my uncle Toby to
raise it up or let it down with the end of his crutch, and with one hand,
which, as his garrison was weak, was as much as he could well spare--but
the disadvantages of such a construction were insurmountable;--for by this
means, he would say, I leave one half of my bridge in my enemy's
possession--and pray of what use is the other?
The natural remedy for this was, no doubt, to have his bridge fast only at
one end with hinges, so that the whole might be lifted up together, and
stand bolt upright--but that was rejected for the reason given above.
For a whole week after he was determined in his mind to have one of that
particular construction which is made to draw back horizontally, to hinder
a passage; and to thrust forwards again to gain a passage--of which sorts
your worship might have seen three famous ones at Spires before its
destruction--and one now at Brisac, if I mistake not;--but my father
advising my uncle Toby, with great earnestness, to have nothing more to do
with thrusting bridges--and my uncle foreseeing moreover that it would but
perpetuate the memory of the Corporal's misfortune--he changed his mind for
that of the marquis d'Hopital's invention, which the younger Bernouilli has
so well and learnedly described, as your worships may see--Act. Erud. Lips.
an. 1695--to these a lead weight is an eternal balance, and keeps watch as
well as a couple of centinels, inasmuch as the construction of them was a
curve line approximating to a cycloid--if not a cycloid itself.
My uncle Toby understood the nature of a parabola as well as any man in
England--but was not quite such a master of the cycloid;--he talked however
about it every day--the bridge went not forwards.--We'll ask somebody about
it, cried my uncle Toby to Trim.
Chapter 2.XIX.
When Trim came in and told my father, that Dr. Slop was in the kitchen, and
busy in making a bridge--my uncle Toby--the affair of the jack-boots having
just then raised a train of military ideas in his brain--took it instantly
for granted that Dr. Slop was making a model of the marquis d'Hopital's
bridge.--'tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle Toby;--pray give my
humble service to Dr. Slop, Trim, and tell him I thank him heartily.
Had my uncle Toby's head been a Savoyard's box, and my father peeping in
all the time at one end of it--it could not have given him a more distinct
conception of the operations of my uncle Toby's imagination, than what he
had; so, notwithstanding the catapulta and battering-ram, and his bitter
imprecation about them, he was just beginning to triumph--
When Trim's answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his brows, and
twisted it to pieces.
Chapter 2.XX.
--This unfortunate draw-bridge of yours, quoth my father--God bless your
honour, cried Trim, 'tis a bridge for master's nose.--In bringing him into
the world with his vile instruments, he has crushed his nose, Susannah
says, as flat as a pancake to his face, and he is making a false bridge
with a piece of cotton and a thin piece of whalebone out of Susannah's
stays, to raise it up.
--Lead me, brother Toby, cried my father, to my room this instant.
Chapter 2.XXI.
From the first moment I sat down to write my life for the amusement of the
world, and my opinions for its instruction, has a cloud insensibly been
gathering over my father.--A tide of little evils and distresses has been
setting in against him.--Not one thing, as he observed himself, has gone
right: and now is the storm thicken'd and going to break, and pour down
full upon his head.
I enter upon this part of my story in the most pensive and melancholy frame
of mind that ever sympathetic breast was touched with.--My nerves relax as
I tell it.--Every line I write, I feel an abatement of the quickness of my
pulse, and of that careless alacrity with it, which every day of my life
prompts me to say and write a thousand things I should not--And this moment
that I last dipp'd my pen into my ink, I could not help taking notice what
a cautious air of sad composure and solemnity there appear'd in my manner
of doing it.--Lord! how different from the rash jerks and hair-brain'd
squirts thou art wont, Tristram, to transact it with in other humours--
dropping thy pen--spurting thy ink about thy table and thy books--as if thy
pen and thy ink, thy books and furniture cost thee nothing!
Chapter 2.XXII.
--I won't go about to argue the point with you--'tis so--and I am persuaded
of it, madam, as much as can be, 'That both man and woman bear pain or
sorrow (and, for aught I know, pleasure too) best in a horizontal
position.'
The moment my father got up into his chamber, he threw himself prostrate
across his bed in the wildest disorder imaginable, but at the same time in
the most lamentable attitude of a man borne down with sorrows, that ever
the eye of pity dropp'd a tear for.--The palm of his right hand, as he fell
upon the bed, receiving his forehead, and covering the greatest part of
both his eyes, gently sunk down with his head (his elbow giving way
backwards) till his nose touch'd the quilt;--his left arm hung insensible
over the side of the bed, his knuckles reclining upon the handle of the
chamber-pot, which peep'd out beyond the valance--his right leg (his left
being drawn up towards his body) hung half over the side of the bed, the
edge of it pressing upon his shin bone--He felt it not. A fix'd,
inflexible sorrow took possession of every line of his face.--He sigh'd
once--heaved his breast often--but uttered not a word.
An old set-stitch'd chair, valanced and fringed around with party coloured
worsted bobs, stood at the bed's head, opposite to the side where my
father's head reclined.--My uncle Toby sat him down in it.
Before an affliction is digested--consolation ever comes too soon;--and
after it is digested--it comes too late: so that you see, madam, there is
but a mark between these two, as fine almost as a hair, for a comforter to
take aim at:--my uncle Toby was always either on this side, or on that of
it, and would often say, he believed in his heart he could as soon hit the
longitude; for this reason, when he sat down in the chair, he drew the
curtain a little forwards, and having a tear at every one's service--he
pull'd out a cambrick handkerchief--gave a low sigh--but held his peace.
Chapter 2.XXIII.
--'All is not gain that is got into the purse.'--So that notwithstanding my
father had the happiness of reading the oddest books in the universe, and
had moreover, in himself, the oddest way of thinking that ever man in it
was bless'd with, yet it had this drawback upon him after all--that it laid
him open to some of the oddest and most whimsical distresses; of which this
particular one, which he sunk under at present, is as strong an example as
can be given.
No doubt, the breaking down of the bridge of a child's nose, by the edge of
a pair of forceps--however scientifically applied--would vex any man in the
world, who was at so much pains in begetting a child, as my father was--yet
it will not account for the extravagance of his affliction, nor will it
justify the un-christian manner he abandoned and surrendered himself up to.
To explain this, I must leave him upon the bed for half an hour--and my
uncle Toby in his old fringed chair sitting beside him.
Chapter 2.XXIV.
--I think it a very unreasonable demand--cried my great-grandfather,
twisting up the paper, and throwing it upon the table.--By this account,
madam, you have but two thousand pounds fortune, and not a shilling more--
and you insist upon having three hundred pounds a year jointure for it.--
--'Because,' replied my great-grandmother, 'you have little or no nose,
Sir.'--
Now before I venture to make use of the word Nose a second time--to avoid
all confusion in what will be said upon it, in this interesting part of my
story, it may not be amiss to explain my own meaning, and define, with all
possible exactness and precision, what I would willingly be understood to
mean by the term: being of opinion, that 'tis owing to the negligence and
perverseness of writers in despising this precaution, and to nothing else--
that all the polemical writings in divinity are not as clear and
demonstrative as those upon a Will o' the Wisp, or any other sound part of
philosophy, and natural pursuit; in order to which, what have you to do,
before you set out, unless you intend to go puzzling on to the day of
judgment--but to give the world a good definition, and stand to it, of the
main word you have most occasion for--changing it, Sir, as you would a
guinea, into small coin?--which done--let the father of confusion puzzle
you, if he can; or put a different idea either into your head, or your
reader's head, if he knows how.
In books of strict morality and close reasoning, such as I am engaged in--
the neglect is inexcusable; and Heaven is witness, how the world has
revenged itself upon me for leaving so many openings to equivocal
strictures--and for depending so much as I have done, all along, upon the
cleanliness of my readers imaginations.
--Here are two senses, cried Eugenius, as we walk'd along, pointing with
the fore finger of his right hand to the word Crevice, in the one hundred
and seventy-eighth page of the first volume of this book of books,--here
are two senses--quoth he.--And here are two roads, replied I, turning short
upon him--a dirty and a clean one--which shall we take?--The clean, by all
means, replied Eugenius. Eugenius, said I, stepping before him, and laying
my hand upon his breast--to define--is to distrust.--Thus I triumph'd over
Eugenius; but I triumph'd over him as I always do, like a fool.--'Tis my
comfort, however, I am not an obstinate one: therefore
I define a nose as follows--intreating only beforehand, and beseeching my
readers, both male and female, of what age, complexion, and condition
soever, for the love of God and their own souls, to guard against the
temptations and suggestions of the devil, and suffer him by no art or wile
to put any other ideas into their minds, than what I put into my
definition--For by the word Nose, throughout all this long chapter of
noses, and in every other part of my work, where the word Nose occurs--I
declare, by that word I mean a nose, and nothing more, or less.
Chapter 2.XXV.
--'Because,' quoth my great grandmother, repeating the words again--'you
have little or no nose, Sir.'--
S'death! cried my great-grandfather, clapping his hand upon his nose,--'tis
not so small as that comes to;--'tis a full inch longer than my father's.--
Now, my great-grandfather's nose was for all the world like unto the noses
of all the men, women, and children, whom Pantagruel found dwelling upon
the island of Ennasin.--By the way, if you would know the strange way of
getting a-kin amongst so flat-nosed a people--you must read the book;--find
it out yourself, you never can.--
--'Twas shaped, Sir, like an ace of clubs.
--'Tis a full inch, continued my grandfather, pressing up the ridge of his
nose with his finger and thumb; and repeating his assertion--'tis a full
inch longer, madam, than my father's--You must mean your uncle's, replied
my great-grandmother.
--My great-grandfather was convinced.--He untwisted the paper, and signed
the article.
Chapter 2.XXVI.
--What an unconscionable jointure, my dear, do we pay out of this small
estate of ours, quoth my grandmother to my grandfather.
My father, replied my grandfather, had no more nose, my dear, saving the
mark, than there is upon the back of my hand.
--Now, you must know, that my great-grandmother outlived my grandfather
twelve years; so that my father had the jointure to pay, a hundred and
fifty pounds half-yearly--(on Michaelmas and Lady-day,)--during all that
time.
No man discharged pecuniary obligations with a better grace than my
father.--And as far as a hundred pounds went, he would fling it upon the
table, guinea by guinea, with that spirited jerk of an honest welcome,
which generous souls, and generous souls only, are able to fling down
money: but as soon as ever he enter'd upon the odd fifty--he generally
gave a loud Hem! rubb'd the side of his nose leisurely with the flat part
of his fore finger--inserted his hand cautiously betwixt his head and the
cawl of his wig--look'd at both sides of every guinea as he parted with it-
-and seldom could get to the end of the fifty pounds, without pulling out
his handkerchief, and wiping his temples.
Defend me, gracious Heaven! from those persecuting spirits who make no
allowances for these workings within us.--Never--O never may I lay down in
their tents, who cannot relax the engine, and feel pity for the force of
education, and the prevalence of opinions long derived from ancestors!
For three generations at least this tenet in favour of long noses had
gradually been taking root in our family.--Tradition was all along on its
side, and Interest was every half-year stepping in to strengthen it; so
that the whimsicality of my father's brain was far from having the whole
honour of this, as it had of almost all his other strange notions.--For in
a great measure he might be said to have suck'd this in with his mother's
milk. He did his part however.--If education planted the mistake (in case
it was one) my father watered it, and ripened it to perfection.
He would often declare, in speaking his thoughts upon the subject, that he
did not conceive how the greatest family in England could stand it out
against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short noses.--And for
the contrary reason, he would generally add, That it must be one of the
greatest problems in civil life, where the same number of long and jolly
noses, following one another in a direct line, did not raise and hoist it
up into the best vacancies in the kingdom.--He would often boast that the
Shandy family rank'd very high in king Harry the VIIIth's time, but owed
its rise to no state engine--he would say--but to that only;--but that,
like other families, he would add--it had felt the turn of the wheel, and
had never recovered the blow of my great-grandfather's nose.--It was an ace
of clubs indeed, he would cry, shaking his head--and as vile a one for an
unfortunate family as ever turn'd up trumps.
--Fair and softly, gentle reader!--where is thy fancy carrying thee!--If
there is truth in man, by my great-grandfather's nose, I mean the external
organ of smelling, or that part of man which stands prominent in his face--
and which painters say, in good jolly noses and well-proportioned faces,
should comprehend a full third--that is, measured downwards from the
setting on of the hair.
--What a life of it has an author, at this pass!
Chapter 2.XXVII.
It is a singular blessing, that nature has form'd the mind of man with the
same happy backwardness and renitency against conviction, which is observed
in old dogs--'of not learning new tricks.'
What a shuttlecock of a fellow would the greatest philosopher that ever
existed be whisk'd into at once, did he read such books, and observe such
facts, and think such thoughts, as would eternally be making him change
sides!
Now, my father, as I told you last year, detested all this--He pick'd up an
opinion, Sir, as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple.--It becomes
his own--and if he is a man of spirit, he would lose his life rather than
give it up.
I am aware that Didius, the great civilian, will contest this point; and
cry out against me, Whence comes this man's right to this apple? ex
confesso, he will say--things were in a state of nature--The apple, is as
much Frank's apple as John's. Pray, Mr. Shandy, what patent has he to shew
for it? and how did it begin to be his? was it, when he set his heart upon
it? or when he gathered it? or when he chew'd it? or when he roasted it? or
when he peel'd, or when he brought it home? or when he digested?--or when
he--?--For 'tis plain, Sir, if the first picking up of the apple, made it
not his--that no subsequent act could.
Brother Didius, Tribonius will answer--(now Tribonius the civilian and
church lawyer's beard being three inches and a half and three eighths
longer than Didius his beard--I'm glad he takes up the cudgels for me, so I
give myself no farther trouble about the answer.)--Brother Didius,
Tribonius will say, it is a decreed case, as you may find it in the
fragments of Gregorius and Hermogines's codes, and in all the codes from
Justinian's down to the codes of Louis and Des Eaux--That the sweat of a
man's brows, and the exsudations of a man's brains, are as much a man's own
property as the breeches upon his backside;--which said exsudations, &c.
being dropp'd upon the said apple by the labour of finding it, and picking
it up; and being moreover indissolubly wasted, and as indissolubly annex'd,
by the picker up, to the thing pick'd up, carried home, roasted, peel'd,
eaten, digested, and so on;--'tis evident that the gatherer of the apple,
in so doing, has mix'd up something which was his own, with the apple which
was not his own, by which means he has acquired a property;--or, in other
words, the apple is John's apple.
By the same learned chain of reasoning my father stood up for all his
opinions; he had spared no pains in picking them up, and the more they lay
out of the common way, the better still was his title.--No mortal claimed
them; they had cost him moreover as much labour in cooking and digesting as
in the case above, so that they might well and truly be said to be of his
own goods and chattels.--Accordingly he held fast by 'em, both by teeth and
claws--would fly to whatever he could lay his hands on--and, in a word,
would intrench and fortify them round with as many circumvallations and
breast-works, as my uncle Toby would a citadel.
There was one plaguy rub in the way of this--the scarcity of materials to
make any thing of a defence with, in case of a smart attack; inasmuch as
few men of great genius had exercised their parts in writing books upon the
subject of great noses: by the trotting of my lean horse, the thing is
incredible! and I am quite lost in my understanding, when I am considering
what a treasure of precious time and talents together has been wasted upon
worse subjects--and how many millions of books in all languages and in all
possible types and bindings, have been fabricated upon points not half so
much tending to the unity and peace-making of the world. What was to be
had, however, he set the greater store by; and though my father would oft-
times sport with my uncle Toby's library--which, by-the-bye, was ridiculous
enough--yet at the very same time he did it, he collected every book and
treatise which had been systematically wrote upon noses, with as much care
as my honest uncle Toby had done those upon military architecture.--'Tis
true, a much less table would have held them--but that was not thy
transgression, my dear uncle.--
Here--but why here--rather than in any other part of my story--I am not
able to tell:--but here it is--my heart stops me to pay to thee, my dear
uncle Toby, once for all, the tribute I owe thy goodness.--Here let me
thrust my chair aside, and kneel down upon the ground, whilst I am pouring
forth the warmest sentiment of love for thee, and veneration for the
excellency of thy character, that ever virtue and nature kindled in a
nephew's bosom.--Peace and comfort rest for evermore upon thy head!--Thou
enviedst no man's comforts--insultedst no man's opinions--Thou blackenedst
no man's character--devouredst no man's bread: gently, with faithful Trim
behind thee, didst thou amble round the little circle of thy pleasures,
jostling no creature in thy way:--for each one's sorrows, thou hadst a
tear,--for each man's need, thou hadst a shilling.
Whilst I am worth one, to pay a weeder--thy path from thy door to thy
bowling-green shall never be grown up.--Whilst there is a rood and a half
of land in the Shandy family, thy fortifications, my dear uncle Toby, shall
never be demolish'd.
Chapter 2.XXVIII.
My father's collection was not great, but to make amends, it was curious;
and consequently he was some time in making it; he had the great good
fortune hewever, to set off well, in getting Bruscambille's prologue upon
long noses, almost for nothing--for he gave no more for Bruscambille than
three half-crowns; owing indeed to the strong fancy which the stall-man saw
my father had for the book the moment he laid his hands upon it.--There are
not three Bruscambilles in Christendom--said the stall-man, except what are
chain'd up in the libraries of the curious. My father flung down the money
as quick as lightning--took Bruscambille into his bosom--hied home from
Piccadilly to Coleman-street with it, as he would have hied home with a
treasure, without taking his hand once off from Bruscambille all the way.
To those who do not yet know of which gender Bruscambille is--inasmuch as a
prologue upon long noses might easily be done by either--'twill be no
objection against the simile--to say, That when my father got home, he
solaced himself with Bruscambille after the manner in which, 'tis ten to
one, your worship solaced yourself with your first mistress--that is, from
morning even unto night: which, by-the-bye, how delightful soever it may
prove to the inamorato--is of little or no entertainment at all to by-
standers.--Take notice, I go no farther with the simile--my father's eye
was greater than his appetite--his zeal greater than his knowledge--he
cool'd--his affections became divided--he got hold of Prignitz--purchased
Scroderus, Andrea Paraeus, Bouchet's Evening Conferences, and above all,
the great and learned Hafen Slawkenbergius; of which, as I shall have much
to say by-and-bye--I will say nothing now.
Chapter 2.XXIX.
Of all the tracts my father was at the pains to procure and study in
support of his hypothesis, there was not any one wherein he felt a more
cruel disappointment at first, than in the celebrated dialogue between
Pamphagus and Cocles, written by the chaste pen of the great and venerable
Erasmus, upon the various uses and seasonable applications of long noses.--
Now don't let Satan, my dear girl, in this chapter, take advantage of any
one spot of rising ground to get astride of your imagination, if you can
any ways help it; or if he is so nimble as to slip on--let me beg of you,
like an unback'd filly, to frisk it, to squirt it, to jump it, to rear it,
to bound it--and to kick it, with long kicks and short kicks, till like
Tickletoby's mare, you break a strap or a crupper, and throw his worship
into the dirt.--You need not kill him.--
--And pray who was Tickletoby's mare?--'tis just as discreditable and
unscholar-like a question, Sir, as to have asked what year (ab. urb. con.)
the second Punic war broke out.--Who was Tickletoby's mare!--Read, read,
read, read, my unlearned reader! read--or by the knowledge of the great
saint Paraleipomenon--I tell you before-hand, you had better throw down the
book at once; for without much reading, by which your reverence knows I
mean much knowledge, you will no more be able to penetrate the moral of the
next marbled page (motley emblem of my work!) than the world with all its
sagacity has been able to unravel the many opinions, transactions, and
truths which still lie mystically hid under the dark veil of the black one.

Chapter 2.XXX.
'Nihil me paenitet hujus nasi,' quoth Pamphagus;--that is--'My nose has
been the making of me.'--'Nec est cur poeniteat,' replies Cocles; that is,
'How the duce should such a nose fail?'
The doctrine, you see, was laid down by Erasmus, as my father wished it,
with the utmost plainness; but my father's disappointment was, in finding
nothing more from so able a pen, but the bare fact itself; without any of
that speculative subtilty or ambidexterity of argumentation upon it, which
Heaven had bestow'd upon man on purpose to investigate truth, and fight for
her on all sides.--My father pish'd and pugh'd at first most terribly--'tis
worth something to have a good name. As the dialogue was of Erasmus, my
father soon came to himself, and read it over and over again with great
application, studying every word and every syllable of it thro' and thro'
in its most strict and literal interpretation--he could still make nothing
of it, that way. Mayhap there is more meant, than is said in it, quoth my
father.--Learned men, brother Toby, don't write dialogues upon long noses
for nothing.--I'll study the mystick and the allegorick sense--here is some
room to turn a man's self in, brother.
My father read on.--
Now I find it needful to inform your reverences and worships, that besides
the many nautical uses of long noses enumerated by Erasmus, the dialogist
affirmeth that a long nose is not without its domestic conveniences also;
for that in a case of distress--and for want of a pair of bellows, it will
do excellently well, ad ixcitandum focum (to stir up the fire.)
Nature had been prodigal in her gifts to my father beyond measure, and had
sown the seeds of verbal criticism as deep within him, as she had done the
seeds of all other knowledge--so that he had got out his penknife, and was
trying experiments upon the sentence, to see if he could not scratch some
better sense into it.--I've got within a single letter, brother Toby, cried
my father, of Erasmus his mystic meaning.--You are near enough, brother,
replied my uncle, in all conscience.--Pshaw! cried my father, scratching
on--I might as well be seven miles off.--I've done it--said my father,
snapping his fingers--See, my dear brother Toby, how I have mended the
sense.--But you have marr'd a word, replied my uncle Toby.--My father put
on his spectacles--bit his lip--and tore out the leaf in a passion.
Chapter 2.XXXI.
O Slawkenbergius! thou faithful analyzer of my Disgrazias--thou sad
foreteller of so many of the whips and short turns which on one stage or
other of my life have come slap upon me from the shortness of my nose, and
no other cause, that I am conscious of.--Tell me, Slawkenbergius! what
secret impulse was it? what intonation of voice? whence came it? how did it
sound in thy ears?--art thou sure thou heard'st it?--which first cried out
to thee--go--go, Slawkenbergius! dedicate the labours of thy life--neglect
thy pastimes--call forth all the powers and faculties of thy nature--
macerate thyself in the service of mankind, and write a grand Folio for
them, upon the subject of their noses.
How the communication was conveyed into Slawkenbergius's sensorium--so that
Slawkenbergius should know whose finger touch'd the key--and whose hand it
was that blew the bellows--as Hafen Slawkenbergius has been dead and laid
in his grave above fourscore and ten years--we can only raise conjectures.
Slawkenbergius was play'd upon, for aught I know, like one of Whitefield's
disciples--that is, with such a distinct intelligence, Sir, of which of the
two masters it was that had been practising upon his instrument--as to make
all reasoning upon it needless.
--For in the account which Hafen Slawkenbergius gives the world of his
motives and occasions for writing, and spending so many years of his life
upon this one work--towards the end of his prolegomena, which by-the-bye
should have come first--but the bookbinder has most injudiciously placed it
betwixt the analytical contents of the book, and the book itself--he
informs his reader, that ever since he had arrived at the age of
discernment, and was able to sit down cooly, and consider within himself
the true state and condition of man, and distinguish the main end and
design of his being;--or--to shorten my translation, for Slawkenbergius's
book is in Latin, and not a little prolix in this passage--ever since I
understood, quoth Slawkenbergius, any thing--or rather what was what--and
could perceive that the point of long noses had been too loosely handled by
all who had gone before;--have I Slawkenbergius, felt a strong impulse,
with a mighty and unresistible call within me, to gird up myself to this
undertaking.
And to do justice to Slawkenbergius, he has entered the list with a
stronger lance, and taken a much larger career in it than any one man who
had ever entered it before him--and indeed, in many respects, deserves to
be en-nich'd as a prototype for all writers, of voluminous works at least,
to model their books by--for he has taken in, Sir, the whole subject--
examined every part of it dialectically--then brought it into full day;
dilucidating it with all the light which either the collision of his own
natural parts could strike--or the profoundest knowledge of the sciences
had impowered him to cast upon it--collating, collecting, and compiling--
begging, borrowing, and stealing, as he went along, all that had been wrote
or wrangled thereupon in the schools and porticos of the learned: so that
Slawkenbergius his book may properly be considered, not only as a model--
but as a thorough-stitched Digest and regular institute of noses,
comprehending in it all that is or can be needful to be known about them.
For this cause it is that I forbear to speak of so many (otherwise)
valuable books and treatises of my father's collecting, wrote either, plump
upon noses--or collaterally touching them;--such for instance as Prignitz,
now lying upon the table before me, who with infinite learning, and from
the most candid and scholar-like examination of above four thousand
different skulls, in upwards of twenty charnel-houses in Silesia, which he
had rummaged--has informed us, that the mensuration and configuration of
the osseous or bony parts of human noses, in any given tract of country,
except Crim Tartary, where they are all crush'd down by the thumb, so that
no judgment can be formed upon them--are much nearer alike, than the world
imagines;--the difference amongst them being, he says, a mere trifle, not
worth taking notice of;--but that the size and jollity of every individual
nose, and by which one nose ranks above another, and bears a higher price,
is owing to the cartilaginous and muscular parts of it, into whose ducts
and sinuses the blood and animal spirits being impell'd and driven by the
warmth and force of the imagination, which is but a step from it (bating
the case of idiots, whom Prignitz, who had lived many years in Turky,
supposes under the more immediate tutelage of Heaven)--it so happens, and
ever must, says Prignitz, that the excellency of the nose is in a direct
arithmetical proportion to the excellency of the wearer's fancy.
It is for the same reason, that is, because 'tis all comprehended in
Slawkenbergius, that I say nothing likewise of Scroderus (Andrea) who, all
the world knows, set himself to oppugn Prignitz with great violence--
proving it in his own way, first logically, and then by a series of
stubborn facts, 'That so far was Prignitz from the truth, in affirming that
the fancy begat the nose, that on the contrary--the nose begat the fancy.'
--The learned suspected Scroderus of an indecent sophism in this--and
Prignitz cried out aloud in the dispute, that Scroderus had shifted the
idea upon him--but Scroderus went on, maintaining his thesis.
My father was just balancing within himself, which of the two sides he
should take in this affair; when Ambrose Paraeus decided it in a moment,
and by overthrowing the systems, both of Prignitz and Scroderus, drove my
father out of both sides of the controversy at once.
Be witness--
I don't acquaint the learned reader--in saying it, I mention it only to
shew the learned, I know the fact myself--
That this Ambrose Paraeus was chief surgeon and nose-mender to Francis the
ninth of France, and in high credit with him and the two preceding, or
succeeding kings (I know not which)--and that, except in the slip he made
in his story of Taliacotius's noses, and his manner of setting them on--he
was esteemed by the whole college of physicians at that time, as more
knowing in matters of noses, than any one who had ever taken them in hand.
Now Ambrose Paraeus convinced my father, that the true and efficient cause
of what had engaged so much the attention of the world, and upon which
Prignitz and Scroderus had wasted so much learning and fine parts--was
neither this nor that--but that the length and goodness of the nose was
owing simply to the softness and flaccidity in the nurse's breast--as the
flatness and shortness of puisne noses was to the firmness and elastic
repulsion of the same organ of nutrition in the hale and lively--which,
tho' happy for the woman, was the undoing of the child, inasmuch as his
nose was so snubb'd, so rebuff'd, so rebated, and so refrigerated thereby,
as never to arrive ad mensuram suam legitimam;--but that in case of the
flaccidity and softness of the nurse or mother's breast--by sinking into
it, quoth Paraeus, as into so much butter, the nose was comforted,
nourish'd, plump'd up, refresh'd, refocillated, and set a growing for ever.
I have but two things to observe of Paraeus; first, That he proves and
explains all this with the utmost chastity and decorum of expression:--for
which may his soul for ever rest in peace!
And, secondly, that besides the systems of Prignitz and Scroderus, which
Ambrose Paraeus his hypothesis effectually overthrew--it overthrew at the
same time the system of peace and harmony of our family; and for three days
together, not only embroiled matters between my father and my mother, but
turn'd likewise the whole house and every thing in it, except my uncle
Toby, quite upside down.
Such a ridiculous tale of a dispute between a man and his wife, never
surely in any age or country got vent through the key-hole of a street-
door.
My mother, you must know--but I have fifty things more necessary to let you
know first--I have a hundred difficulties which I have promised to clear
up, and a thousand distresses and domestick misadventures crowding in upon
me thick and threefold, one upon the neck of another. A cow broke in
(tomorrow morning) to my uncle Toby's fortifications, and eat up two
rations and a half of dried grass, tearing up the sods with it, which faced
his horn-work and covered way.--Trim insists upon being tried by a court-
martial--the cow to be shot--Slop to be crucifix'd--myself to be tristram'd
and at my very baptism made a martyr of;--poor unhappy devils that we all
are!--I want swaddling--but there is no time to be lost in exclamations--I
have left my father lying across his bed, and my uncle Toby in his old
fringed chair, sitting beside him, and promised I would go back to them in
half an hour; and five-and-thirty minutes are laps'd already.--Of all the
perplexities a mortal author was ever seen in--this certainly is the
greatest, for I have Hafen Slawkenbergius's folio, Sir, to finish--a
dialogue between my father and my uncle Toby, upon the solution of
Prignitz, Scroderus, Ambrose Paraeus, Panocrates, and Grangousier to
relate--a tale out of Slawkenbergius to translate, and all this in five
minutes less than no time at all;--such a head!--would to Heaven my enemies
only saw the inside of it!
Chapter 2.XXXII.
There was not any one scene more entertaining in our family--and to do it
justice in this point;--and I here put off my cap and lay it upon the table
close beside my ink-horn, on purpose to make my declaration to the world
concerning this one article the more solemn--that I believe in my soul
(unless my love and partiality to my understanding blinds me) the hand of
the supreme Maker and first Designer of all things never made or put a
family together (in that period at least of it which I have sat down to
write the story of)--where the characters of it were cast or contrasted
with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for this end; or in which the
capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers of shifting
them perpetually from morning to night, were lodged and intrusted with so
unlimited a confidence, as in the Shandy Family.
Not any one of these was more diverting, I say, in this whimsical theatre
of ours--than what frequently arose out of this self-same chapter of long
noses--especially when my father's imagination was heated with the enquiry,
and nothing would serve him but to heat my uncle Toby's too.
My uncle Toby would give my father all possible fair play in this attempt;
and with infinite patience would sit smoking his pipe for whole hours
together, whilst my father was practising upon his head, and trying every
accessible avenue to drive Prignitz and Scroderus's solutions into it.
Whether they were above my uncle Toby's reason--or contrary to it--or that
his brain was like damp timber, and no spark could possibly take hold--or
that it was so full of saps, mines, blinds, curtins, and such military
disqualifications to his seeing clearly into Prignitz and Scroderus's
doctrines--I say not--let schoolmen--scullions, anatomists, and engineers,
fight for it among themselves--
'Twas some misfortune, I make no doubt, in this affair, that my father had
every word of it to translate for the benefit of my uncle Toby, and render
out of Slawkenbergius's Latin, of which, as he was no great master, his
translation was not always of the purest--and generally least so where
'twas most wanted.--This naturally open'd a door to a second misfortune;--
that in the warmer paroxysms of his zeal to open my uncle Toby's eyes--my
father's ideas ran on as much faster than the translation, as the
translation outmoved my uncle Toby's--neither the one or the other added
much to the perspicuity of my father's lecture.
Chapter 2.XXXIII.
The gift of ratiocination and making syllogisms--I mean in man--for in
superior classes of being, such as angels and spirits--'tis all done, may
it please your worships, as they tell me, by Intuition;--and beings
inferior, as your worships all know--syllogize by their noses: though
there is an island swimming in the sea (though not altogether at its ease)
whose inhabitants, if my intelligence deceives me not, are so wonderfully
gifted, as to syllogize after the same fashion, and oft-times to make very
well out too:--but that's neither here nor there--
The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, or--the great and
principal act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell us, is the finding
out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another, by the
intervention of a third (called the medius terminus); just as a man, as
Locke well observes, by a yard, finds two mens nine-pin-alleys to be of the
same length, which could not be brought together, to measure their
equality, by juxta-position.
Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated his systems
of noses, and observed my uncle Toby's deportment--what great attention he
gave to every word--and as oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with
what wonderful seriousness he contemplated the length of it--surveying it
transversely as he held it betwixt his finger and his thumb--then fore-
right--then this way, and then that, in all its possible directions and
fore-shortenings--he would have concluded my uncle Toby had got hold of the
medius terminus, and was syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of
each hypothesis of long noses, in order, as my father laid them before him. 
This, by-the-bye, was more than my father wanted--his aim in all the pains
he was at in these philosophick lectures--was to enable my uncle Toby not
to discuss--but comprehend--to hold the grains and scruples of learning--
not to weigh them.--My uncle Toby, as you will read in the next chapter,
did neither the one or the other.
Chapter 2.XXXIV.
'Tis a pity, cried my father one winter's night, after a three hours
painful translation of Slawkenbergius--'tis a pity, cried my father,
putting my mother's threadpaper into the book for a mark, as he spoke--that
truth, brother Toby, should shut herself up in such impregnable fastnesses,
and be so obstinate as not to surrender herself sometimes up upon the
closest siege.--
Now it happened then, as indeed it had often done before, that my uncle
Toby's fancy, during the time of my father's explanation of Prignitz to
him--having nothing to stay it there, had taken a short flight to the
bowling-green;--his body might as well have taken a turn there too--so that
with all the semblance of a deep school-man intent upon the medius
terminus--my uncle Toby was in fact as ignorant of the whole lecture, and
all its pros and cons, as if my father had been translating Hafen
Slawkenbergius from the Latin tongue into the Cherokee. But the word
siege, like a talismanic power, in my father's metaphor, wafting back my
uncle Toby's fancy, quick as a note could follow the touch--he open'd his
ears--and my father observing that he took his pipe out of his mouth, and
shuffled his chair nearer the table, as with a desire to profit--my father
with great pleasure began his sentence again--changing only the plan, and
dropping the metaphor of the siege of it, to keep clear of some dangers my
father apprehended from it.
'Tis a pity, said my father, that truth can only be on one side, brother
Toby--considering what ingenuity these learned men have all shewn in their
solutions of noses.--Can noses be dissolved? replied my uncle Toby.
--My father thrust back his chair--rose up--put on his hat--took four long
strides to the door--jerked it open--thrust his head half way out--shut the
door again--took no notice of the bad hinge--returned to the table--pluck'd
my mother's thread-paper out of Slawkenbergius's book--went hastily to his
bureau--walked slowly back--twisted my mother's thread-paper about his
thumb--unbutton'd his waistcoat--threw my mother's thread-paper into the
fire--bit her sattin pin-cushion in two, fill'd his mouth with bran--
confounded it;--but mark!--the oath of confusion was levell'd at my uncle
Toby's brain--which was e'en confused enough already--the curse came
charged only with the bran--the bran, may it please your honours, was no
more than powder to the ball.
'Twas well my father's passions lasted not long; for so long as they did
last, they led him a busy life on't; and it is one of the most
unaccountable problems that ever I met with in my observations of human
nature, that nothing should prove my father's mettle so much, or make his
passions go off so like gun-powder, as the unexpected strokes his science
met with from the quaint simplicity of my uncle Toby's questions.--Had ten
dozen of hornets stung him behind in so many different places all at one
time--he could not have exerted more mechanical functions in fewer seconds-
-or started half so much, as with one single quaere of three words
unseasonably popping in full upon him in his hobby-horsical career.
'Twas all one to my uncle Toby--he smoked his pipe on with unvaried
composure--his heart never intended offence to his brother--and as his head
could seldom find out where the sting of it lay--he always gave my father
the credit of cooling by himself.--He was five minutes and thirty-five
seconds about it in the present case.
By all that's good! said my father, swearing, as he came to himself, and
taking the oath out of Ernulphus's digest of curses--(though to do my
father justice it was a fault (as he told Dr. Slop in the affair of
Ernulphus) which he as seldom committed as any man upon earth)--By all
that's good and great! brother Toby, said my father, if it was not for the
aids of philosophy, which befriend one so much as they do--you would put a
man beside all temper.--Why, by the solutions of noses, of which I was
telling you, I meant, as you might have known, had you favoured me with one
grain of attention, the various accounts which learned men of different
kinds of knowledge have given the world of the causes of short and long
noses.--There is no cause but one, replied my uncle Toby--why one man's
nose is longer than another's, but because that God pleases to have it so.-
-That is Grangousier's solution, said my father.--'Tis he, continued my
uncle Toby, looking up, and not regarding my father's interruption, who
makes us all, and frames and puts us together in such forms and
proportions, and for such ends, as is agreeable to his infinite wisdom,.--
'Tis a pious account, cried my father, but not philosophical--there is more
religion in it than sound science. 'Twas no inconsistent part of my uncle
Toby's character--that he feared God, and reverenced religion.--So the
moment my father finished his remark--my uncle Toby fell a whistling
Lillabullero with more zeal (though more out of tune) than usual.--
What is become of my wife's thread-paper?
Chapter 2.XXXV.
No matter--as an appendage to seamstressy, the thread-paper might be of
some consequence to my mother--of none to my father, as a mark in
Slawkenbergius. Slawkenbergius in every page of him was a rich treasure of
inexhaustible knowledge to my father--he could not open him amiss; and he
would often say in closing the book, that if all the arts and sciences in
the world, with the books which treated of them, were lost--should the
wisdom and policies of governments, he would say, through disuse, ever
happen to be forgot, and all that statesmen had wrote or caused to be
written, upon the strong or the weak sides of courts and kingdoms, should
they be forgot also--and Slawkenbergius only left--there would be enough in
him in all conscience, he would say, to set the world a-going again. A
treasure therefore was he indeed! an institute of all that was necessary to
be known of noses, and every thing else--at matin, noon, and vespers was
Hafen Slawkenbergius his recreation and delight: 'twas for ever in his
hands--you would have sworn, Sir, it had been a canon's prayer-book--so
worn, so glazed, so contrited and attrited was it with fingers and with
thumbs in all its parts, from one end even unto the other.
I am not such a bigot to Slawkenbergius as my father;--there is a fund in
him, no doubt: but in my opinion, the best, I don't say the most
profitable, but the most amusing part of Hafen Slawkenbergius, is his
tales--and, considering he was a German, many of them told not without
fancy:--these take up his second book, containing nearly one half of his
folio, and are comprehended in ten decads, each decad containing ten tales-
-Philosophy is not built upon tales; and therefore 'twas certainly wrong in
Slawkenbergius to send them into the world by that name!--there are a few
of them in his eighth, ninth, and tenth decads, which I own seem rather
playful and sportive, than speculative--but in general they are to be
looked upon by the learned as a detail of so many independent facts, all of
them turning round somehow or other upon the main hinges of his subject,
and added to his work as so many illustrations upon the doctrines of noses.
As we have leisure enough upon our hands--if you give me leave, madam, I'll
tell you the ninth tale of his tenth decad.
Slawkenbergii Fabella (As Hafen Slawkenbergius de Nasis is extremely
scarce, it may not be unacceptable to the learned reader to see the
specimen of a few pages of his original; I will make no reflection upon it,
but that his story-telling Latin is much more concise than his philosophic-
-and, I think, has more of Latinity in it.)
Vespera quadam frigidula, posteriori in parte mensis Augusti, peregrinus,
mulo fusco colore incidens, mantica a tergo, paucis indusiis, binis
calceis, braccisque sericis coccineis repleta, Argentoratum ingressus est.
Militi eum percontanti, quum portus intraret dixit, se apud Nasorum
promontorium fuisse, Francofurtum proficisci, et Argentoratum, transitu ad
fines Sarmatiae mensis intervallo, reversurum.
Miles peregrini in faciem suspexit--Di boni, nova forma nasi!
At multum mihi profuit, inquit peregrinus, carpum amento extrahens, e quo
pependit acinaces: Loculo manum inseruit; et magna cum urbanitate, pilei
parte anteriore tacta manu sinistra, ut extendit dextram, militi florinum
dedit et processit.
Dolet mihi, ait miles, tympanistam nanum et valgum alloquens, virum adeo
urbanum vaginam perdidisse: itinerari haud poterit nuda acinaci; neque
vaginam toto Argentorato, habilem inveniet.--Nullam unquam habui, respondit
peregrinus respiciens--seque comiter inclinans--hoc more gesto, nudam
acinacem elevans, mulo lento progrediente, ut nasum tueri possim.
Non immerito, benigne peregrine, respondit miles.
Nihili aestimo, ait ille tympanista, e pergamena factitius est.
Prout christianus sum, inquit miles, nasus ille, ni sexties major fit, meo
esset conformis.
Crepitare audivi ait tympanista.
Mehercule! sanguinem emisit, respondit miles.
Miseret me, inquit tympanista, qui non ambo tetigimus!
Eodem temporis puncto, quo haec res argumentata fuit inter militem et
tympanistam, disceptabatur ibidem tubicine et uxore sua qui tunc
accesserunt, et peregrino praetereunte, restiterunt.
Quantus nasus! aeque longus est, ait tubicina, ac tuba.
Et ex eodem metallo, ait tubicen, velut sternutamento audias.
Tantum abest, respondit illa, quod fistulam dulcedine vincit.
Aeneus est, ait tubicen.
Nequaquam, respondit uxor.
Rursum affirmo, ait tubicen, quod aeneus est.
Rem penitus explorabo; prius, enim digito tangam, ait uxor, quam dormivero,
Mulus peregrini gradu lento progressus est, ut unumquodque verbum
controversiae, non tantum inter militem et tympanistam, verum etiam inter
tubicinem et uxorum ejus, audiret.
Nequaquam, ait ille, in muli collum fraena demittens, et manibus ambabus in
pectus positis, (mulo lente progrediente) nequaquam, ait ille respiciens,
non necesse est ut res isthaec dilucidata foret. Minime gentium! meus

uxor burgomagistri.
Peregrinus illi non respondit. Votum faciebat tunc temporis sancto
Nicolao; quo facto, sinum dextrum inserens, e qua negligenter pependit
acinaces, lento gradu processit per plateam Argentorati latam quae ad

Quod ubi peregrinus esset ingressus, uxorem tubicinis obviam euntem

Slawkenbergius's Tale
It was one cool refreshing evening, at the close of a very sultry day, in
the latter end of the month of August, when a stranger, mounted upon a dark
mule, with a small cloak-bag behind him, containing a few shirts, a pair of
shoes, and a crimson-sattin pair of breeches, entered the town of
Strasburg.
He told the centinel, who questioned him as he entered the gates, that he
had been at the Promontory of Noses--was going on to Frankfort--and should
be back again at Strasburg that day month, in his way to the borders of
Crim Tartary.
The centinel looked up into the stranger's face--he never saw such a Nose
in his life!
--I have made a very good venture of it, quoth the stranger--so slipping
his wrist out of the loop of a black ribbon, to which a short scymetar was
hung, he put his hand into his pocket, and with great courtesy touching the
fore part of his cap with his left hand, as he extended his right--he put a
florin into the centinel's hand, and passed on.
It grieves, me, said the centinel, speaking to a little dwarfish bandy-
legg'd drummer, that so courteous a soul should have lost his scabbard--he
cannot travel without one to his scymetar, and will not be able to get a
scabbard to fit it in all Strasburg.--I never had one, replied the
stranger, looking back to the centinel, and putting his hand up to his cap
as he spoke--I carry it, continued he, thus--holding up his naked scymetar,
his mule moving on slowly all the time--on purpose to defend my nose.
It is well worth it, gentle stranger, replied the centinel.
--'Tis not worth a single stiver, said the bandy-legg'd drummer--'tis a
nose of parchment.
As I am a true catholic--except that it is six times as big--'tis a nose,
said the centinel, like my own.
--I heard it crackle, said the drummer.
By dunder, said the centinel, I saw it bleed.
What a pity, cried the bandy-legg'd drummer, we did not both touch it!
At the very time that this dispute was maintaining by the centinel and the
drummer--was the same point debating betwixt a trumpeter and a trumpeter's
wife, who were just then coming up, and had stopped to see the stranger
pass by.
Benedicity!--What a nose! 'tis as long, said the trumpeter's wife, as a
trumpet.
And of the same metal said the trumpeter, as you hear by its sneezing.
'Tis as soft as a flute, said she.
--'Tis brass, said the trumpeter.
--'Tis a pudding's end, said his wife.
I tell thee again, said the trumpeter, 'tis a brazen nose,
I'll know the bottom of it, said the trumpeter's wife, for I will touch it
with my finger before I sleep.
The stranger's mule moved on at so slow a rate, that he heard every word of
the dispute, not only betwixt the centinel and the drummer, but betwixt the
trumpeter and trumpeter's wife.
No! said he, dropping his reins upon his mule's neck, and laying both his
hands upon his breast, the one over the other in a saint-like position (his
mule going on easily all the time) No! said he, looking up--I am not such a
debtor to the world--slandered and disappointed as I have been--as to give
it that conviction--no! said he, my nose shall never be touched whilst
Heaven gives me strength--To do what? said a burgomaster's wife.
The stranger took no notice of the burgomaster's wife--he was making a vow
to Saint Nicolas; which done, having uncrossed his arms with the same
solemnity with which he crossed them, he took up the reins of his bridle
with his left-hand, and putting his right hand into his bosom, with the
scymetar hanging loosely to the wrist of it, he rode on, as slowly as one
foot of the mule could follow another, thro' the principal streets of
Strasburg, till chance brought him to the great inn in the market-place
over-against the church.
The moment the stranger alighted, he ordered his mule to be led into the
stable, and his cloak-bag to be brought in; then opening, and taking out of
it his crimson-sattin breeches, with a silver-fringed--(appendage to them,
which I dare not translate)--he put his breeches, with his fringed cod-
piece on, and forth-with, with his short scymetar in his hand, walked out
to the grand parade.
The stranger had just taken three turns upon the parade, when he perceived
the trumpeter's wife at the opposite side of it--so turning short, in pain
lest his nose should be attempted, he instantly went back to his inn--
undressed himself, packed up his crimson-sattin breeches, &c. in his cloak-
bag, and called for his mule.
I am going forwards, said the stranger, for Frankfort--and shall be back at
Strasburg this day month.
I hope, continued the stranger, stroking down the face of his mule with his
left hand as he was going to mount it, that you have been kind to this
faithful slave of mine--it has carried me and my cloak-bag, continued he,
tapping the mule's back, above six hundred leagues.
--'Tis a long journey, Sir, replied the master of the inn--unless a man has
great business.--Tut! tut! said the stranger, I have been at the promontory
of Noses; and have got me one of the goodliest, thank Heaven, that ever
fell to a single man's lot.
Whilst the stranger was giving this odd account of himself, the master of
the inn and his wife kept both their eyes fixed full upon the stranger's
nose--By saint Radagunda, said the inn-keeper's wife to herself, there is
more of it than in any dozen of the largest noses put together in all
Strasburg! is it not, said she, whispering her husband in his ear, is it
not a noble nose?
'Tis an imposture, my dear, said the master of the inn--'tis a false nose.
'Tis a true nose, said his wife.
'Tis made of fir-tree, said he, I smell the turpentine.--
There's a pimple on it, said she.
'Tis a dead nose, replied the inn-keeper.
'Tis a live nose, and if I am alive myself, said the inn-keeper's, wife, I
will touch it.
I have made a vow to saint Nicolas this day, said the stranger, that my
nose shall not be touched till--Here the stranger suspending his voice,
looked up.--Till when? said she hastily.
It never shall be touched, said he, clasping his hands and bringing them
close to his breast, till that hour--What hour? cried the inn keeper's
wife.--Never!--never! said the stranger, never till I am got--For Heaven's
sake, into what place? said she--The stranger rode away without saying a
word.
The stranger had not got half a league on his way towards Frankfort before
all the city of Strasburg was in an uproar about his nose. The Compline
bells were just ringing to call the Strasburgers to their devotions, and
shut up the duties of the day in prayer:--no soul in all Strasburg heard
'em--the city was like a swarm of bees--men, women, and children, (the
Compline bells tinkling all the time) flying here and there--in at one
door, out at another--this way and that way--long ways and cross ways--up
one street, down another street--in at this alley, out of that--did you see
it? did you see it? did you see it? O! did you see it?--who saw it? who
did see it? for mercy's sake, who saw it?
Alack o'day! I was at vespers!--I was washing, I was starching, I was
scouring, I was quilting--God help me! I never saw it--I never touch'd
it!--would I had been a centinel, a bandy-legg'd drummer, a trumpeter, a
trumpeter's wife, was the general cry and lamentation in every street and
corner of Strasburg.
Whilst all this confusion and disorder triumphed throughout the great city
of Strasburg, was the courteous stranger going on as gently upon his mule
in his way to Frankfort, as if he had no concern at all in the affair--
talking all the way he rode in broken sentences, sometimes to his mule--
sometimes to himself--sometimes to his Julia.
O Julia, my lovely Julia!--nay I cannot stop to let thee bite that thistle-
-that ever the suspected tongue of a rival should have robbed me of
enjoyment when I was upon the point of tasting it.--
--Pugh!--'tis nothing but a thistle--never mind it--thou shalt have a
better supper at night.
--Banish'd from my country--my friends--from thee.--
Poor devil, thou'rt sadly tired with thy journey!--come--get on a little
faster--there's nothing in my cloak-bag but two shirts--a crimson-sattin
pair of breeches, and a fringed--Dear Julia!
--But why to Frankfort?--is it that there is a hand unfelt, which secretly
is conducting me through these meanders and unsuspected tracts?
--Stumbling! by saint Nicolas! every step--why at this rate we shall be all
night in getting in--
--To happiness--or am I to be the sport of fortune and slander--destined to
be driven forth unconvicted--unheard--untouch'd--if so, why did I not stay
at Strasburg, where justice--but I had sworn! Come, thou shalt drink--to
St. Nicolas--O Julia!--What dost thou prick up thy ears at?--'tis nothing
but a man, &c.
The stranger rode on communing in this manner with his mule and Julia--till
he arrived at his inn, where, as soon as he arrived, he alighted--saw his
mule, as he had promised it, taken good care of--took off his cloak-bag,
with his crimson-sattin breeches, &c. in it--called for an omelet to his
supper, went to his bed about twelve o'clock, and in five minutes fell fast
asleep.
It was about the same hour when the tumult in Strasburg being abated for
that night,--the Strasburgers had all got quietly into their beds--but not
like the stranger, for the rest either of their minds or bodies; queen Mab,
like an elf as she was, had taken the stranger's nose, and without
reduction of its bulk, had that night been at the pains of slitting and
dividing it into as many noses of different cuts and fashions, as there
were heads in Strasburg to hold them. The abbess of Quedlingberg, who with
the four great dignitaries of her chapter, the prioress, the deaness, the
sub-chantress, and senior canonness, had that week come to Strasburg to
consult the university upon a case of conscience relating to their placket-
holes--was ill all the night.
The courteous stranger's nose had got perched upon the top of the pineal
gland of her brain, and made such rousing work in the fancies of the four
great dignitaries of her chapter, they could not get a wink of sleep the
whole night thro' for it--there was no keeping a limb still amongst them--
in short, they got up like so many ghosts.
The penitentiaries of the third order of saint Francis--the nuns of mount
Calvary--the Praemonstratenses--the Clunienses (Hafen Slawkenbergius means
the Benedictine nuns of Cluny, founded in the year 940, by Odo, abbe de
Cluny.)--the Carthusians, and all the severer orders of nuns, who lay that
night in blankets or hair-cloth, were still in a worse condition than the
abbess of Quedlingberg--by tumbling and tossing, and tossing and tumbling
from one side of their beds to the other the whole night long--the several
sisterhoods had scratch'd and maul'd themselves all to death--they got out
of their beds almost flay'd alive--every body thought saint Antony had
visited them for probation with his fire--they had never once, in short,
shut their eyes the whole night long from vespers to matins.
The nuns of saint Ursula acted the wisest--they never attempted to go to
bed at all.
The dean of Strasburg, the prebendaries, the capitulars and domiciliars
(capitularly assembled in the morning to consider the case of butter'd
buns) all wished they had followed the nuns of saint Ursula's example.--
In the hurry and confusion every thing had been in the night before, the
bakers had all forgot to lay their leaven--there were no butter'd buns to
be had for breakfast in all Strasburg--the whole close of the cathedral was
in one eternal commotion--such a cause of restlessness and disquietude, and
such a zealous inquiry into that cause of the restlessness, had never
happened in Strasburg, since Martin Luther, with his doctrines, had turned
the city upside down.
If the stranger's nose took this liberty of thrusting himself thus into the
dishes (Mr. Shandy's compliments to orators--is very sensible that
Slawkenbergius has here changed his metaphor--which he is very guilty of:--
that as a translator, Mr. Shandy has all along done what he could to make
him stick to it--but that here 'twas impossible.) of religious orders, &c.
what a carnival did his nose make of it, in those of the laity!--'tis more
than my pen, worn to the stump as it is, has power to describe; tho', I
acknowledge, (cries Slawkenbergius with more gaiety of thought than I could
have expected from him) that there is many a good simile now subsisting in
the world which might give my countrymen some idea of it; but at the close
of such a folio as this, wrote for their sakes, and in which I have spent
the greatest part of my life--tho' I own to them the simile is in being,
yet would it not be unreasonable in them to expect I should have either
time or inclination to search for it? Let it suffice to say, that the riot
and disorder it occasioned in the Strasburgers fantasies was so general--
such an overpowering mastership had it got of all the faculties of the
Strasburgers minds--so many strange things, with equal confidence on all
sides, and with equal eloquence in all places, were spoken and sworn to
concerning it, that turned the whole stream of all discourse and wonder
towards it--every soul, good and bad--rich and poor--learned and unlearned-
-doctor and student--mistress and maid--gentle and simple--nun's flesh and
woman's flesh, in Strasburg spent their time in hearing tidings about it--
every eye in Strasburg languished to see it--every finger--every thumb in
Strasburg burned to touch it.
Now what might add, if any thing may be thought necessary to add, to so
vehement a desire--was this, that the centinel, the bandy-legg'd drummer,
the trumpeter, the trumpeter's wife, the burgomaster's widow, the master of
the inn, and the master of the inn's wife, how widely soever they all
differed every one from another in their testimonies and description of the
stranger's nose--they all agreed together in two points--namely, that he
was gone to Frankfort, and would not return to Strasburg till that day
month; and secondly, whether his nose was true or false, that the stranger
himself was one of the most perfect paragons of beauty--the finest-made
man--the most genteel!--the most generous of his purse--the most courteous
in his carriage, that had ever entered the gates of Strasburg--that as he
rode, with scymetar slung loosely to his wrist, thro' the streets--and
walked with his crimson-sattin breeches across the parade--'twas with so
sweet an air of careless modesty, and so manly withal--as would have put
the heart in jeopardy (had his nose not stood in his way) of every virgin
who had cast her eyes upon him.
I call not upon that heart which is a stranger to the throbs and yearnings
of curiosity, so excited, to justify the abbess of Quedlingberg, the
prioress, the deaness, and sub-chantress, for sending at noon-day for the
trumpeter's wife: she went through the streets of Strasburg with her
husband's trumpet in her hand,--the best apparatus the straitness of the
time would allow her, for the illustration of her theory--she staid no
longer than three days.
The centinel and bandy-legg'd drummer!--nothing on this side of old Athens
could equal them! they read their lectures under the city-gates to comers
and goers, with all the pomp of a Chrysippus and a Crantor in their
porticos.
The master of the inn, with his ostler on his left-hand, read his also in
the same stile--under the portico or gateway of his stable-yard--his wife,
hers more privately in a back room: all flocked to their lectures; not
promiscuously--but to this or that, as is ever the way, as faith and
credulity marshal'd them--in a word, each Strasburger came crouding for
intelligence--and every Strasburger had the intelligence he wanted.
'Tis worth remarking, for the benefit of all demonstrators in natural
philosophy, &c. that as soon as the trumpeter's wife had finished the
abbess of Quedlingberg's private lecture, and had begun to read in public,
which she did upon a stool in the middle of the great parade,--she
incommoded the other demonstrators mainly, by gaining incontinently the
most fashionable part of the city of Strasburg for her auditory--But when a
demonstrator in philosophy (cries Slawkenbergius) has a trumpet for an
apparatus, pray what rival in science can pretend to be heard besides him?
Whilst the unlearned, thro' these conduits of intelligence, were all busied
in getting down to the bottom of the well, where Truth keeps her little
court--were the learned in their way as busy in pumping her up thro' the
conduits of dialect induction--they concerned themselves not with facts--
they reasoned--
Not one profession had thrown more light upon this subject than the
Faculty--had not all their disputes about it run into the affair of Wens
and oedematous swellings, they could not keep clear of them for their
bloods and souls--the stranger's nose had nothing to do either with wens or
oedematous swellings.
It was demonstrated however very satisfactorily, that such a ponderous mass
of heterogenous matter could not be congested and conglomerated to the
nose, whilst the infant was in Utera, without destroying the statical
balance of the foetus, and throwing it plump upon its head nine months
before the time.--
--The opponents granted the theory--they denied the consequences.
And if a suitable provision of veins, arteries, &c. said they, was not laid
in, for the due nourishment of such a nose, in the very first stamina and
rudiments of its formation, before it came into the world (bating the case
of Wens) it could not regularly grow and be sustained afterwards.
This was all answered by a dissertation upon nutriment, and the effect
which nutriment had in extending the vessels, and in the increase and
prolongation of the muscular parts to the greatest growth and expansion
imaginable--In the triumph of which theory, they went so far as to affirm,
that there was no cause in nature, why a nose might not grow to the size of
the man himself.
The respondents satisfied the world this event could never happen to them
so long as a man had but one stomach and one pair of lungs--For the
stomach, said they, being the only organ destined for the reception of
food, and turning it into chyle--and the lungs the only engine of
sanguification--it could possibly work off no more, than what the appetite
brought it: or admitting the possibility of a man's overloading his
stomach, nature had set bounds however to his lungs--the engine was of a
determined size and strength, and could elaborate but a certain quantity in
a given time--that is, it could produce just as much blood as was
sufficient for one single man, and no more; so that, if there was as much
nose as man--they proved a mortification must necessarily ensue; and
forasmuch as there could not be a support for both, that the nose must
either fall off from the man, or the man inevitably fall off from his nose.
Nature accommodates herself to these emergencies, cried the opponents--else
what do you say to the case of a whole stomach--a whole pair of lungs, and
but half a man, when both his legs have been unfortunately shot off?
He dies of a plethora, said they--or must spit blood, and in a fortnight or
three weeks go off in a consumption.--
--It happens otherwise--replied the opponents.--
It ought not, said they.
The more curious and intimate inquirers after nature and her doings, though
they went hand in hand a good way together, yet they all divided about the
nose at last, almost as much as the Faculty itself
They amicably laid it down, that there was a just and geometrical
arrangement and proportion of the several parts of the human frame to its
several destinations, offices, and functions, which could not be
transgressed but within certain limits--that nature, though she sported--
she sported within a certain circle;--and they could not agree about the
diameter of it.
The logicians stuck much closer to the point before them than any of the
classes of the literati;--they began and ended with the word Nose; and had
it not been for a petitio principii, which one of the ablest of them ran
his head against in the beginning of the combat, the whole controversy had
been settled at once.
A nose, argued the logician, cannot bleed without blood--and not only
blood--but blood circulating in it to supply the phaenomenon with a
succession of drops--(a stream being but a quicker succession of drops,
that is included, said he.)--Now death, continued the logician, being
nothing but the stagnation of the blood--
I deny the definition--Death is the separation of the soul from the body,
said his antagonist--Then we don't agree about our weapons, said the
logician--Then there is an end of the dispute, replied the antagonist.
The civilians were still more concise: what they offered being more in the
nature of a decree--than a dispute.
Such a monstrous nose, said they, had it been a true nose, could not
possibly have been suffered in civil society--and if false--to impose upon
society with such false signs and tokens, was a still greater violation of
its rights, and must have had still less mercy shewn it.
The only objection to this was, that if it proved any thing, it proved the
stranger's nose was neither true nor false.
This left room for the controversy to go on. It was maintained by the
advocates of the ecclesiastic court, that there was nothing to inhibit a
decree, since the stranger ex mero motu had confessed he had been at the
Promontory of Noses, and had got one of the goodliest, &c. &c.--To this it
was answered, it was impossible there should be such a place as the
Promontory of Noses, and the learned be ignorant where it lay. The
commissary of the bishop of Strasburg undertook the advocates, explained
this matter in a treatise upon proverbial phrases, shewing them, that the
Promontory of Noses was a mere allegorick expression, importing no more
than that nature had given him a long nose: in proof of which, with great
learning, he cited the underwritten authorities, (Nonnulli ex nostratibus

incontestably, had it not appeared that a dispute about some franchises of
dean and chapter-lands had been determined by it nineteen years before.
It happened--I must say unluckily for Truth, because they were giving her a
lift another way in so doing; that the two universities of Strasburg--the
Lutheran, founded in the year 1538 by Jacobus Surmis, counsellor of the
senate,--and the Popish, founded by Leopold, arch-duke of Austria, were,
during all this time, employing the whole depth of their knowledge (except
just what the affair of the abbess of Quedlingberg's placket-holes
required)--in determining the point of Martin Luther's damnation.
The Popish doctors had undertaken to demonstrate a priori, that from the
necessary influence of the planets on the twenty-second day of October
1483--when the moon was in the twelfth house, Jupiter, Mars, and Venus in
the third, the Sun, Saturn, and Mercury, all got together in the fourth--
that he must in course, and unavoidably, be a damn'd man--and that his
doctrines, by a direct corollary, must be damn'd doctrines too.
By inspection into his horoscope, where five planets were in coition all at
once with Scorpio (Haec mira, satisque horrenda. Planetarum coitio sub
Scorpio Asterismo in nona coeli statione, quam Arabes religioni deputabant
efficit Martinum Lutherum sacrilegum hereticum, Christianae religionis
hostem acerrimum atque prophanum, ex horoscopi directione ad Martis coitum,
religiosissimus obiit, ejus Anima scelestissima ad infernos navigavit--ab
Alecto, Tisiphone & Megara flagellis igneis cruciata perenniter.--Lucas
Gaurieus in Tractatu astrologico de praeteritis multorum hominum
accidentibus per genituras examinatis.) (in reading this my father would
always shake his head) in the ninth house, with the Arabians allotted to
religion--it appeared that Martin Luther did not care one stiver about the
matter--and that from the horoscope directed to the conjunction of Mars--
they made it plain likewise he must die cursing and blaspheming--with the
blast of which his soul (being steep'd in guilt) sailed before the wind, in
the lake of hell-fire.
The little objection of the Lutheran doctors to this, was, that it must
certainly be the soul of another man, born Oct. 22, 83. which was forced to
sail down before the wind in that manner--inasmuch as it appeared from the
register of Islaben in the county of Mansfelt, that Luther was not born in
the year 1483, but in 84; and not on the 22d day of October, but on the
10th of November, the eve of Martinmas day, from whence he had the name of
Martin.
(--I must break off my translation for a moment; for if I did not, I know I
should no more be able to shut my eyes in bed, than the abbess of
Quedlingberg--It is to tell the reader; that my father never read this
passage of Slawkenbergius to my uncle Toby, but with triumph--not over my
uncle Toby, for he never opposed him in it--but over the whole world.
--Now you see, brother Toby, he would say, looking up, 'that christian
names are not such indifferent things;'--had Luther here been called by any
other name but Martin, he would have been damn'd to all eternity--Not that
I look upon Martin, he would add, as a good name--far from it--'tis
something better than a neutral, and but a little--yet little as it is you
see it was of some service to him.
My father knew the weakness of this prop to his hypothesis, as well as the
best logician could shew him--yet so strange is the weakness of man at the
same time, as it fell in his way, he could not for his life but make use of
it; and it was certainly for this reason, that though there are many
stories in Hafen Slawkenbergius's Decades full as entertaining as this I am
translating, yet there is not one amongst them which my father read over
with half the delight--it flattered two of his strangest hypotheses
together--his Names and his Noses.--I will be bold to say, he might have
read all the books in the Alexandrian Library, had not fate taken other
care of them, and not have met with a book or passage in one, which hit two
such nails as these upon the head at one stroke.)
The two universities of Strasburg were hard tugging at this affair of
Luther's navigation. The Protestant doctors had demonstrated, that he had
not sailed right before the wind, as the Popish doctors had pretended; and
as every one knew there was no sailing full in the teeth of it--they were
going to settle, in case he had sailed, how many points he was off; whether
Martin had doubled the cape, or had fallen upon a lee-shore; and no doubt,
as it was an enquiry of much edification, at least to those who understood
this sort of Navigation, they had gone on with it in spite of the size of
the stranger's nose, had not the size of the stranger's nose drawn off the
attention of the world from what they were about--it was their business to
follow.
The abbess of Quedlingberg and her four dignitaries was no stop; for the
enormity of the stranger's nose running full as much in their fancies as
their case of conscience--the affair of their placket-holes kept cold--in a
word, the printers were ordered to distribute their types--all
controversies dropp'd.
'Twas a square cap with a silver tassel upon the crown of it--to a nut-
shell--to have guessed on which side of the nose the two universities would
split.
'Tis above reason, cried the doctors on one side.
'Tis below reason, cried the others.
'Tis faith, cried one.
'Tis a fiddle-stick, said the other.
'Tis possible, cried the one.
'Tis impossible, said the other.
God's power is infinite, cried the Nosarians, he can do any thing.
He can do nothing, replied the Anti-nosarians, which implies
contradictions.
He can make matter think, said the Nosarians.
As certainly as you can make a velvet cap out of a sow's ear, replied the
Anti-nosarians.
He cannot make two and two five, replied the Popish doctors.--'Tis false,
said their other opponents.--
Infinite power is infinite power, said the doctors who maintained the
reality of the nose.--It extends only to all possible things, replied the
Lutherans.
By God in heaven, cried the Popish doctors, he can make a nose, if he
thinks fit, as big as the steeple of Strasburg.
Now the steeple of Strasburg being the biggest and the tallest church-
steeple to be seen in the whole world, the Anti-nosarians denied that a
nose of 575 geometrical feet in length could be worn, at least by a middle-
siz'd man--The Popish doctors swore it could--The Lutheran doctors said
No;--it could not.
This at once started a new dispute, which they pursued a great way, upon
the extent and limitation of the moral and natural attributes of God--That
controversy led them naturally into Thomas Aquinas, and Thomas Aquinas to
the devil.
The stranger's nose was no more heard of in the dispute--it just served as
a frigate to launch them into the gulph of school-divinity--and then they
all sailed before the wind.
Heat is in proportion to the want of true knowledge.
The controversy about the attributes, &c. instead of cooling, on the
contrary had inflamed the Strasburgers imaginations to a most inordinate
degree--The less they understood of the matter the greater was their wonder
about it--they were left in all the distresses of desire unsatisfied--saw
their doctors, the Parchmentarians, the Brassarians, the Turpentarians, on
one side--the Popish doctors on the other, like Pantagruel and his
companions in quest of the oracle of the bottle, all embarked out of sight.
--The poor Strasburgers left upon the beach!
--What was to be done?--No delay--the uproar increased--every one in
disorder--the city gates set open.--
Unfortunate Strasbergers! was there in the store-house of nature--was there
in the lumber-rooms of learning--was there in the great arsenal of chance,
one single engine left undrawn forth to torture your curiosities, and
stretch your desires, which was not pointed by the hand of Fate to play
upon your hearts?--I dip not my pen into my ink to excuse the surrender of
yourselves--'tis to write your panegyrick. Shew me a city so macerated
with expectation--who neither eat, or drank, or slept, or prayed, or
hearkened to the calls either of religion or nature, for seven-and-twenty
days together, who could have held out one day longer.
On the twenty-eighth the courteous stranger had promised to return to
Strasburg.
Seven thousand coaches (Slawkenbergius must certainly have made some
mistake in his numeral characters) 7000 coaches--15000 single-horse chairs-
-20000 waggons, crowded as full as they could all hold with senators,
counsellors, syndicks--beguines, widows, wives, virgins, canons,
concubines, all in their coaches--The abbess of Quedlingberg, with the
prioress, the deaness and sub-chantress, leading the procession in one
coach, and the dean of Strasburg, with the four great dignitaries of his
chapter, on her left-hand--the rest following higglety-pigglety as they
could; some on horseback--some on foot--some led--some driven--some down
the Rhine--some this way--some that--all set out at sun-rise to meet the
courteous stranger on the road.
Haste we now towards the catastrophe of my tale--I say Catastrophe (cries
Slawkenbergius) inasmuch as a tale, with parts rightly disposed, not only
rejoiceth (gaudet) in the Catastrophe and Peripeitia of a Drama, but
rejoiceth moreover in all the essential and integrant parts of it--it has
its Protasis, Epitasis, Catastasis, its Catastrophe or Peripeitia growing
one out of the other in it, in the order Aristotle first planted them--
without which a tale had better never be told at all, says Slawkenbergius,
but be kept to a man's self.
In all my ten tales, in all my ten decades, have I Slawkenbergius tied down
every tale of them as tightly to this rule, as I have done this of the
stranger and his nose.
--From his first parley with the centinel, to his leaving the city of
Strasburg, after pulling off his crimson-sattin pair of breeches, is the
Protasis or first entrance--where the characters of the Personae Dramatis
are just touched in, and the subject slightly begun.
The Epitasis, wherein the action is more fully entered upon and heightened,
till it arrives at its state or height called the Catastasis, and which
usually takes up the 2d and 3d act, is included within that busy period of
my tale, betwixt the first night's uproar about the nose, to the conclusion
of the trumpeter's wife's lectures upon it in the middle of the grand
parade: and from the first embarking of the learned in the dispute--to the
doctors finally sailing away, and leaving the Strasburgers upon the beach
in distress, is the Catastasis or the ripening of the incidents and
passions for their bursting forth in the fifth act.
This commences with the setting out of the Strasburgers in the Frankfort
road, and terminates in unwinding the labyrinth and bringing the hero out
of a state of agitation (as Aristotle calls it) to a state of rest and
quietness.
This, says Hafen Slawkenbergius, constitutes the Catastrophe or Peripeitia
of my tale--and that is the part of it I am going to relate.
We left the stranger behind the curtain asleep--he enters now upon the
stage.
--What dost thou prick up thy ears at?--'tis nothing but a man upon a
horse--was the last word the stranger uttered to his mule. It was not
proper then to tell the reader, that the mule took his master's word for
it; and without any more ifs or ands, let the traveller and his horse pass
by.
The traveller was hastening with all diligence to get to Strasburg that
night. What a fool am I, said the traveller to himself, when he had rode
about a league farther, to think of getting into Strasburg this night.--
Strasburg!--the great Strasburg!--Strasburg, the capital of all Alsatia! 
Strasburg, an imperial city! Strasburg, a sovereign state! Strasburg,
garrisoned with five thousand of the best troops in all the world!--Alas!
if I was at the gates of Strasburg this moment, I could not gain admittance
into it for a ducat--nay a ducat and half--'tis too much--better go back to
the last inn I have passed--than lie I know not where--or give I know not
what. The traveller, as he made these reflections in his mind, turned his
horse's head about, and three minutes after the stranger had been conducted
into his chamber, he arrived at the same inn.
--We have bacon in the house, said the host, and bread--and till eleven
o'clock this night had three eggs in it--but a stranger, who arrived an
hour ago, has had them dressed into an omelet, and we have nothing.--
Alas! said the traveller, harassed as I am, I want nothing but a bed.--I
have one as soft as is in Alsatia, said the host.
--The stranger, continued he, should have slept in it, for 'tis my best
bed, but upon the score of his nose.--He has got a defluxion, said the
traveller.--Not that I know, cried the host.--But 'tis a camp-bed, and
Jacinta, said he, looking towards the maid, imagined there was not room in
it to turn his nose in.--Why so? cried the traveller, starting back.--It is
so long a nose, replied the host.--The traveller fixed his eyes upon
Jacinta, then upon the ground--kneeled upon his right knee--had just got
his hand laid upon his breast--Trifle not with my anxiety, said he rising
up again.--'Tis no trifle, said Jacinta, 'tis the most glorious nose!--The
traveller fell upon his knee again--laid his hand upon his breast--then,
said he, looking up to heaven, thou hast conducted me to the end of my
pilgrimage--'Tis Diego.
The traveller was the brother of the Julia, so often invoked that night by
the stranger as he rode from Strasburg upon his mule; and was come, on her
part, in quest of him. He had accompanied his sister from Valadolid across
the Pyrenean mountains through France, and had many an entangled skein to
wind off in pursuit of him through the many meanders and abrupt turnings of
a lover's thorny tracks.
--Julia had sunk under it--and had not been able to go a step farther than
to Lyons, where, with the many disquietudes of a tender heart, which all
talk of--but few feel--she sicken'd, but had just strength to write a
letter to Diego; and having conjured her brother never to see her face till
he had found him out, and put the letter into his hands, Julia took to her
bed.
Fernandez (for that was her brother's name)--tho' the camp-bed was as soft
as any one in Alsace, yet he could not shut his eyes in it.--As soon as it
was day he rose, and hearing Diego was risen too, he entered his chamber,
and discharged his sister's commission.
The letter was as follows:
'Seig. Diego,
'Whether my suspicions of your nose were justly excited or not--'tis not
now to inquire--it is enough I have not had firmness to put them to farther
tryal.
'How could I know so little of myself, when I sent my Duenna to forbid your
coming more under my lattice? or how could I know so little of you, Diego,
as to imagine you would not have staid one day in Valadolid to have given
ease to my doubts?--Was I to be abandoned, Diego, because I was deceived?
or was it kind to take me at my word, whether my suspicions were just or
no, and leave me, as you did, a prey to much uncertainty and sorrow?
'In what manner Julia has resented this--my brother, when he puts this
letter into your hands, will tell you; He will tell you in how few moments
she repented of the rash message she had sent you--in what frantic haste
she flew to her lattice, and how many days and nights together she leaned
immoveably upon her elbow, looking through it towards the way which Diego
was wont to come.
'He will tell you, when she heard of your departure--how her spirits
deserted her--how her heart sicken'd--how piteously she mourned--how low
she hung her head. O Diego! how many weary steps has my brother's pity led
me by the hand languishing to trace out yours; how far has desire carried
me beyond strength--and how oft have I fainted by the way, and sunk into
his arms, with only power to cry out--O my Diego!
'If the gentleness of your carriage has not belied your heart, you will fly
to me, almost as fast as you fled from me--haste as you will--you will
arrive but to see me expire.--'Tis a bitter draught, Diego, but oh! 'tis
embittered still more by dying un. . .--'
She could proceed no farther.
Slawkenbergius supposes the word intended was unconvinced, but her strength
would not enable her to finish her letter.
The heart of the courteous Diego over-flowed as he read the letter--he
ordered his mule forthwith and Fernandez's horse to be saddled; and as no
vent in prose is equal to that of poetry in such conflicts--chance, which
as often directs us to remedies as to diseases, having thrown a piece of
charcoal into the window--Diego availed himself of it, and whilst the
hostler was getting ready his mule, he eased his mind against the wall as
follows.
Ode.
Harsh and untuneful are the notes of love,
Unless my Julia strikes the key,
Her hand alone can touch the part,
Whose dulcet movement charms the heart,
And governs all the man with sympathetick sway.
2d.
O Julia!
The lines were very natural--for they were nothing at all to the purpose,
says Slawkenbergius, and 'tis a pity there were no more of them; but
whether it was that Seig. Diego was slow in composing verses--or the
hostler quick in saddling mules--is not averred; certain it was, that
Diego's mule and Fernandez's horse were ready at the door of the inn,
before Diego was ready for his second stanza; so without staying to finish
his ode, they both mounted, sallied forth, passed the Rhine, traversed
Alsace, shaped their course towards Lyons, and before the Strasburgers and
the abbess of Quedlingberg had set out on their cavalcade, had Fernandez,
Diego, and his Julia, crossed the Pyrenean mountains, and got safe to
Valadolid.
'Tis needless to inform the geographical reader, that when Diego was in
Spain, it was not possible to meet the courteous stranger in the Frankfort
road; it is enough to say, that of all restless desires, curiosity being
the strongest--the Strasburgers felt the full force of it; and that for
three days and nights they were tossed to and fro in the Frankfort road,
with the tempestuous fury of this passion, before they could submit to
return home.--When alas! an event was prepared for them, of all other, the
most grievous that could befal a free people.
As this revolution of the Strasburgers affairs is often spoken of, and
little understood, I will, in ten words, says Slawkenbergius, give the
world an explanation of it, and with it put an end to my tale.
Every body knows of the grand system of Universal Monarchy, wrote by order
of Mons. Colbert, and put in manuscript into the hands of Lewis the
fourteenth, in the year 1664.
'Tis as well known, that one branch out of many of that system, was the
getting possession of Strasburg, to favour an entrance at all times into
Suabia, in order to disturb the quiet of Germany--and that in consequence
of this plan, Strasburg unhappily fell at length into their hands.
It is the lot of a few to trace out the true springs of this and such like
revolutions--The vulgar look too high for them--Statesmen look too low--
Truth (for once) lies in the middle.
What a fatal thing is the popular pride of a free city! cries one
historian--The Strasburgers deemed it a diminution of their freedom to
receive an imperial garrison--so fell a prey to a French one.
The fate, says another, of the Strasburgers, may be a warning to all free
people to save their money.--They anticipated their revenues--brought
themselves under taxes, exhausted their strength, and in the end became so
weak a people, they had not strength to keep their gates shut, and so the
French pushed them open.
Alas! alas! cries Slawkenbergius, 'twas not the French,--'twas Curiosity
pushed them open--The French indeed, who are ever upon the catch, when they
saw the Strasburgers, men, women and children, all marched out to follow
the stranger's nose--each man followed his own, and marched in.
Trade and manufactures have decayed and gradually grown down ever since--
but not from any cause which commercial heads have assigned; for it is
owing to this only, that Noses have ever so run in their heads, that the
Strasburgers could not follow their business.
Alas! alas! cries Slawkenbergius, making an exclamation--it is not the
first--and I fear will not be the last fortress that has been either won--
or lost by Noses.
The End of Slawkenbergius's Tale.
Chapter 2.XXXVI.
With all this learning upon Noses running perpetually in my father's fancy-
-with so many family prejudices--and ten decades of such tales running on
for ever along with them--how was it possible with such exquisite--was it a
true nose?--That a man with such exquisite feelings as my father had, could
bear the shock at all below stairs--or indeed above stairs, in any other
posture, but the very posture I have described?
--Throw yourself down upon the bed, a dozen times--taking care only to
place a looking-glass first in a chair on one side of it, before you do it-
-But was the stranger's nose a true nose, or was it a false one?
To tell that before-hand, madam, would be to do injury to one of the best
tales in the Christian-world; and that is the tenth of the tenth decade,
which immediately follows this.
This tale, cried Slawkenbergius, somewhat exultingly, has been reserved by
me for the concluding tale of my whole work; knowing right well, that when
I shall have told it, and my reader shall have read it thro'--'twould be
even high time for both of us to shut up the book; inasmuch, continues
Slawkenbergius, as I know of no tale which could possibly ever go down
after it.
'Tis a tale indeed!
This sets out with the first interview in the inn at Lyons, when Fernandez
left the courteous stranger and his sister Julia alone in her chamber, and
is over-written.
The Intricacies of Diego and Julia.
Heavens! thou art a strange creature, Slawkenbergius! what a whimsical view
of the involutions of the heart of woman hast thou opened! how this can
ever be translated, and yet if this specimen of Slawkenbergius's tales, and
the exquisitiveness of his moral, should please the world--translated shall
a couple of volumes be.--Else, how this can ever be translated into good
English, I have no sort of conception--There seems in some passages to want
a sixth sense to do it rightly.--What can he mean by the lambent
pupilability of slow, low, dry chat, five notes below the natural tone--
which you know, madam, is little more than a whisper? The moment I
pronounced the words, I could perceive an attempt towards a vibration in
the strings, about the region of the heart.--The brain made no
acknowledgment.--There's often no good understanding betwixt 'em--I felt as
if I understood it.--I had no ideas.--The movement could not be without
cause.--I'm lost. I can make nothing of it--unless, may it please your
worships, the voice, in that case being little more than a whisper,
unavoidably forces the eyes to approach not only within six inches of each
other--but to look into the pupils--is not that dangerous?--But it can't be
avoided--for to look up to the cieling, in that case the two chins
unavoidably meet--and to look down into each other's lap, the foreheads
come to immediate contact, which at once puts an end to the conference--I
mean to the sentimental part of it.--What is left, madam, is not worth
stooping for.
Chapter 2.XXXVII.
My father lay stretched across the bed as still as if the hand of death had
pushed him down, for a full hour and a half before he began to play upon
the floor with the toe of that foot which hung over the bed-side; my uncle
Toby's heart was a pound lighter for it.--In a few moments, his left-hand,
the knuckles of which had all the time reclined upon the handle of the
chamber-pot, came to its feeling--he thrust it a little more within the
valance--drew up his hand, when he had done, into his bosom--gave a hem! 
My good uncle Toby, with infinite pleasure, answered it; and full gladly
would have ingrafted a sentence of consolation upon the opening it
afforded: but having no talents, as I said, that way, and fearing moreover
that he might set out with something which might make a bad matter worse,
he contented himself with resting his chin placidly upon the cross of his
crutch.
Now whether the compression shortened my uncle Toby's face into a more
pleasurable oval--or that the philanthropy of his heart, in seeing his
brother beginning to emerge out of the sea of his afflictions, had braced
up his muscles--so that the compression upon his chin only doubled the
benignity which was there before, is not hard to decide.--My father, in
turning his eyes, was struck with such a gleam of sun-shine in his face, as
melted down the sullenness of his grief in a moment.
He broke silence as follows:
Chapter 2.XXXVIII.
Did ever man, brother Toby, cried my father, raising himself upon his
elbow, and turning himself round to the opposite side of the bed, where my
uncle Toby was sitting in his old fringed chair, with his chin resting upon
his crutch--did ever a poor unfortunate man, brother Toby, cried my father,
receive so many lashes?--The most I ever saw given, quoth my uncle Toby
(ringing the bell at the bed's head for Trim) was to a grenadier, I think
in Mackay's regiment.
--Had my uncle Toby shot a bullet through my father's heart, he could not
have fallen down with his nose upon the quilt more suddenly.
Bless me! said my uncle Toby.
Chapter 2.XXXIX.
Was it Mackay's regiment, quoth my uncle Toby, where the poor grenadier was
so unmercifully whipp'd at Bruges about the ducats?--O Christ! he was
innocent! cried Trim, with a deep sigh.--And he was whipp'd, may it please
your honour, almost to death's door.--They had better have shot him
outright, as he begg'd, and he had gone directly to heaven, for he was as
innocent as your honour.--I thank thee, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby.--I never
think of his, continued Trim, and my poor brother Tom's misfortunes, for we
were all three school-fellows, but I cry like a coward.--Tears are no proof
of cowardice, Trim.--I drop them oft-times myself, cried my uncle Toby.--I
know your honour does, replied Trim, and so am not ashamed of it myself.--
But to think, may it please your honour, continued Trim, a tear stealing
into the corner of his eye as he spoke--to think of two virtuous lads with
hearts as warm in their bodies, and as honest as God could make them--the
children of honest people, going forth with gallant spirits to seek their
fortunes in the world--and fall into such evils!--poor Tom! to be tortured
upon a rack for nothing--but marrying a Jew's widow who sold sausages--
honest Dick Johnson's soul to be scourged out of his body, for the ducats
another man put into his knapsack!--O!--these are misfortunes, cried Trim,-
-pulling out his handkerchief--these are misfortunes, may it please your
honour, worth lying down and crying over.
--My father could not help blushing.
'Twould be a pity, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, thou shouldst ever feel
sorrow of thy own--thou feelest it so tenderly for others.--Alack-o-day,
replied the corporal, brightening up his face--your honour knows I have
neither wife or child--I can have no sorrows in this world.--My father
could not help smiling.--As few as any man, Trim, replied my uncle Toby;
nor can I see how a fellow of thy light heart can suffer, but from the
distress of poverty in thy old age--when thou art passed all services,
Trim--and hast outlived thy friends.--An' please your honour, never fear,
replied Trim, chearily.--But I would have thee never fear, Trim, replied my
uncle Toby, and therefore, continued my uncle Toby, throwing down his
crutch, and getting up upon his legs as he uttered the word therefore--in
recompence, Trim, of thy long fidelity to me, and that goodness of thy
heart I have had such proofs of--whilst thy master is worth a shilling--
thou shalt never ask elsewhere, Trim, for a penny. Trim attempted to thank
my uncle Toby--but had not power--tears trickled down his cheeks faster
than he could wipe them off--He laid his hands upon his breast--made a bow
to the ground, and shut the door.
--I have left Trim my bowling-green, cried my uncle Toby--My father
smiled.--I have left him moreover a pension, continued my uncle Toby.--My
father looked grave.
Chapter 2.XL.
Is this a fit time, said my father to himself, to talk of Pensions and
Grenadiers?
Chapter 2.XLI.
When my uncle Toby first mentioned the grenadier, my father, I said, fell
down with his nose flat to the quilt, and as suddenly as if my uncle Toby
had shot him; but it was not added that every other limb and member of my
father instantly relapsed with his nose into the same precise attitude in
which he lay first described; so that when corporal Trim left the room, and
my father found himself disposed to rise off the bed--he had all the little
preparatory movements to run over again, before he could do it. Attitudes
are nothing, madam--'tis the transition from one attitude to another--like
the preparation and resolution of the discord into harmony, which is all in
all.
For which reason my father played the same jig over again with his toe upon
the floor--pushed the chamber-pot still a little farther within the
valance--gave a hem--raised himself up upon his elbow--and was just
beginning to address himself to my uncle Toby--when recollecting the
unsuccessfulness of his first effort in that attitude--he got upon his
legs, and in making the third turn across the room, he stopped short before
my uncle Toby; and laying the three first fingers of his right-hand in the
palm of his left, and stooping a little, he addressed himself to my uncle
Toby as follows:
Chapter 2.XLII.
When I reflect, brother Toby, upon Man; and take a view of that dark side
of him which represents his life as open to so many causes of trouble--when
I consider, brother Toby, how oft we eat the bread of affliction, and that
we are born to it, as to the portion of our inheritance--I was born to
nothing, quoth my uncle Toby, interrupting my father--but my commission. 
Zooks! said my father, did not my uncle leave you a hundred and twenty
pounds a year?--What could I have done without it? replied my uncle Toby--
That's another concern, said my father testily--But I say Toby, when one
runs over the catalogue of all the cross-reckonings and sorrowful Items
with which the heart of man is overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden
resources the mind is enabled to stand out, and bear itself up, as it does,
against the impositions laid upon our nature.--'Tis by the assistance of
Almighty God, cried my uncle Toby, looking up, and pressing the palms of
his hands close together--'tis not from our own strength, brother Shandy--a
centinel in a wooden centry-box might as well pretend to stand it out
against a detachment of fifty men.--We are upheld by the grace and the
assistance of the best of Beings.
--That is cutting the knot, said my father, instead of untying it,--But
give me leave to lead you, brother Toby, a little deeper into the mystery.
With all my heart, replied my uncle Toby.
My father instantly exchanged the attitude he was in, for that in which
Socrates is so finely painted by Raffael in his school of Athens; which
your connoisseurship knows is so exquisitely imagined, that even the
particular manner of the reasoning of Socrates is expressed by it--for he
holds the fore-finger of his left-hand between the fore-finger and the
thumb of his right, and seems as if he was saying to the libertine he is
reclaiming--'You grant me this--and this: and this, and this, I don't ask
of you--they follow of themselves in course.'
So stood my father, holding fast his fore-finger betwixt his finger and his
thumb, and reasoning with my uncle Toby as he sat in his old fringed chair,
valanced around with party-coloured worsted bobs--O Garrick!--what a rich
scene of this would thy exquisite powers make! and how gladly would I write
such another to avail myself of thy immortality, and secure my own behind
it.
Chapter 2.XLIII.
Though man is of all others the most curious vehicle, said my father, yet
at the same time 'tis of so slight a frame, and so totteringly put
together, that the sudden jerks and hard jostlings it unavoidably meets
with in this rugged journey, would overset and tear it to pieces a dozen
times a day--was it not, brother Toby, that there is a secret spring within
us.--Which spring, said my uncle Toby, I take to be Religion.--Will that
set my child's nose on? cried my father, letting go his finger, and
striking one hand against the other.--It makes every thing straight for us,
answered my uncle Toby.--Figuratively speaking, dear Toby, it may, for
aught I know, said my father; but the spring I am speaking of, is that
great and elastic power within us of counterbalancing evil, which, like a
secret spring in a well-ordered machine, though it can't prevent the shock-
-at least it imposes upon our sense of it.
Now, my dear brother, said my father, replacing his fore-finger, as he was
coming closer to the point--had my child arrived safe into the world,
unmartyr'd in that precious part of him--fanciful and extravagant as I may
appear to the world in my opinion of christian names, and of that magic
bias which good or bad names irresistibly impress upon our characters and
conducts--Heaven is witness! that in the warmest transports of my wishes
for the prosperity of my child, I never once wished to crown his head with
more glory and honour than what George or Edward would have spread around
it.
But alas! continued my father, as the greatest evil has befallen him--I
must counteract and undo it with the greatest good.
He shall be christened Trismegistus, brother.
I wish it may answer--replied my uncle Toby, rising up.
Chapter 2.XLIV.
What a chapter of chances, said my father, turning himself about upon the
first landing, as he and my uncle Toby were going down stairs, what a long
chapter of chances do the events of this world lay open to us! Take pen
and ink in hand, brother Toby, and calculate it fairly--I know no more of
calculation than this balluster, said my uncle Toby (striking short of it
with his crutch, and hitting my father a desperate blow souse upon his
shin-bone)--'Twas a hundred to one-cried my uncle Toby--I thought, quoth my
father, (rubbing his shin) you had known nothing of calculations, brother
Toby. a mere chance, said my uncle Toby.--Then it adds one to the chapter-
-replied my father.
The double success of my father's repartees tickled off the pain of his
shin at once--it was well it so fell out--(chance! again)--or the world to
this day had never known the subject of my father's calculation--to guess
it--there was no chance--What a lucky chapter of chances has this turned
out! for it has saved me the trouble of writing one express, and in truth I
have enough already upon my hands without it.--Have not I promised the
world a chapter of knots? two chapters upon the right and the wrong end of
a woman? a chapter upon whiskers? a chapter upon wishes?--a chapter of
noses?--No, I have done that--a chapter upon my uncle Toby's modesty? to
say nothing of a chapter upon chapters, which I will finish before I sleep-
-by my great grandfather's whiskers, I shall never get half of 'em through
this year.
Take pen and ink in hand, and calculate it fairly, brother Toby, said my
father, and it will turn out a million to one, that of all the parts of the
body, the edge of the forceps should have the ill luck just to fall upon
and break down that one part, which should break down the fortunes of our
house with it.
It might have been worse, replied my uncle Toby.--I don't comprehend, said
my father.--Suppose the hip had presented, replied my uncle Toby, as Dr.
Slop foreboded.
My father reflected half a minute--looked down--touched the middle of his
forehead slightly with his finger--
--True, said he.
Chapter 2.XLV.
Is it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going down one
pair of stairs? for we are got no farther yet than to the first landing,
and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom; and for aught I know,
as my father and my uncle Toby are in a talking humour, there may be as
many chapters as steps:--let that be as it will, Sir, I can no more help it
than my destiny:--A sudden impulse comes across me--drop the curtain,
Shandy--I drop it--Strike a line here across the paper, Tristram--I strike
it--and hey for a new chapter.
The deuce of any other rule have I to govern myself by in this affair--and
if I had one--as I do all things out of all rule--I would twist it and tear
it to pieces, and throw it into the fire when I had done--Am I warm? I am,
and the cause demands it--a pretty story! is a man to follow rules--or
rules to follow him?
Now this, you must know, being my chapter upon chapters, which I promised
to write before I went to sleep, I thought it meet to ease my conscience
entirely before I laid down, by telling the world all I knew about the
matter at once: Is not this ten times better than to set out dogmatically
with a sententious parade of wisdom, and telling the world a story of a
roasted horse--that chapters relieve the mind--that they assist--or impose
upon the imagination--and that in a work of this dramatic cast they are as
necessary as the shifting of scenes--with fifty other cold conceits, enough
to extinguish the fire which roasted him?--O! but to understand this, which
is a puff at the fire of Diana's temple--you must read Longinus--read away-
-if you are not a jot the wiser by reading him the first time over--never
fear--read him again--Avicenna and Licetus read Aristotle's metaphysicks
forty times through a-piece, and never understood a single word.--But mark
the consequence--Avicenna turned out a desperate writer at all kinds of
writing--for he wrote books de omni scribili; and for Licetus (Fortunio)
though all the world knows he was born a foetus, (Ce Foetus n'etoit pas
plus grand que la paume de la main; mais son pere l'ayant examine en
qualite de Medecin, & ayant trouve que c'etoit quelque chose de plus qu'un
Embryon, le fit transporter tout vivant a Rapallo, ou il le fit voir a
Jerome Bardi & a d'autres Medecins du lieu. On trouva qu'il ne lui
manquoit rien d'essentiel a la vie; & son pere pour faire voir un essai de
son experience, entreprit d'achever l'ouvrage de la Nature, & de travailler
a la formation de l'Enfant avec le meme artifice que celui dont on se sert
pour faire ecclorre les Poulets en Egypte. Il instruisit une Nourisse de
tout ce qu'elle avoit a faire, & ayant fait mettre son fils dans un pour
proprement accommode, il reussit a l'elever & a lui faire prendre ses
accroissemens necessaires, par l'uniformite d'une chaleur etrangere mesuree
exactement sur les degres d'un Thermometre, ou d'un autre instrument
equivalent. (Vide Mich. Giustinian, ne gli Scritt. Liguri a 223. 488.) On
auroit toujours ete tres satisfait de l'industrie d'un pere si experimente
dans l'Art de la Generation, quand il n'auroit pu prolonger la vie a son
fils que pour Puelques mois, ou pour peu d'annees. Mais quand on se
represente que l'Enfant a vecu pres de quatre-vingts ans, & qu'il a compose
quatre-vingts Ouvrages differents tous fruits d'une longue lecture--il faut
convenir que tout ce qui est incroyable n'est pas toujours faux, & que la
Vraisemblance n'est pas toujours du cote la Verite. Il n'avoit que dix
neuf ans lorsqu'il composa Gonopsychanthropologia de Origine Animae
humanae. (Les Enfans celebres, revus & corriges par M. de la Monnoye de
l'Academie Francoise.)) of no more than five inches and a half in length,
yet he grew to that astonishing height in literature, as to write a book
with a title as long as himself--the learned know I mean his
Gonopsychanthropologia, upon the origin of the human soul.
So much for my chapter upon chapters, which I hold to be the best chapter
in my whole work; and take my word, whoever reads it, is full as well
employed, as in picking straws.
Chapter 2.XLVI.
We shall bring all things to rights, said my father, setting his foot upon
the first step from the landing.--This Trismegistus, continued my father,
drawing his leg back and turning to my uncle Toby--was the greatest (Toby)
of all earthly beings--he was the greatest king--the greatest lawgiver--the
greatest philosopher--and the greatest priest--and engineer--said my uncle
Toby.
--In course, said my father.
Chapter 2.XLVII.
--And how does your mistress? cried my father, taking the same step over
again from the landing, and calling to Susannah, whom he saw passing by the
foot of the stairs with a huge pin-cushion in her hand--how does your
mistress? As well, said Susannah, tripping by, but without looking up, as
can be expected.--What a fool am I! said my father, drawing his leg back
again--let things be as they will, brother Toby, 'tis ever the precise
answer--And how is the child, pray?--No answer. And where is Dr. Slop?
added my father, raising his voice aloud, and looking over the ballusters--
Susannah was out of hearing.
Of all the riddles of a married life, said my father, crossing the landing
in order to set his back against the wall, whilst he propounded it to my
uncle Toby--of all the puzzling riddles, said he, in a marriage state,--of
which you may trust me, brother Toby, there are more asses loads than all
Job's stock of asses could have carried--there is not one that has more
intricacies in it than this--that from the very moment the mistress of the
house is brought to bed, every female in it, from my lady's gentlewoman
down to the cinder-wench, becomes an inch taller for it; and give
themselves more airs upon that single inch, than all their other inches put
together.
I think rather, replied my uncle Toby, that 'tis we who sink an inch
lower.--If I meet but a woman with child--I do it.--'Tis a heavy tax upon
that half of our fellow-creatures, brother Shandy, said my uncle Toby--'Tis
a piteous burden upon 'em, continued he, shaking his head--Yes, yes, 'tis a
painful thing--said my father, shaking his head too--but certainly since
shaking of heads came into fashion, never did two heads shake together, in
concert, from two such different springs.
God bless / Deuce take 'em all--said my uncle Toby and my father, each to
himself.
Chapter 2.XVLIII.
Holla!--you, chairman!--here's sixpence--do step into that bookseller's
shop, and call me a day-tall critick. I am very willing to give any one of
'em a crown to help me with his tackling, to get my father and my uncle
Toby off the stairs, and to put them to bed.
--'Tis even high time; for except a short nap, which they both got whilst
Trim was boring the jack-boots--and which, by-the-bye, did my father no
sort of good, upon the score of the bad hinge--they have not else shut
their eyes, since nine hours before the time that doctor Slop was led into
the back parlour in that dirty pickle by Obadiah.
Was every day of my life to be as busy a day as this--and to take up--
Truce.
I will not finish that sentence till I have made an observation upon the
strange state of affairs between the reader and myself, just as things
stand at present--an observation never applicable before to any one
biographical writer since the creation of the world, but to myself--and I
believe, will never hold good to any other, until its final destruction--
and therefore, for the very novelty of it alone, it must be worth your
worships attending to.
I am this month one whole year older than I was this time twelve-month; and
having got, as you perceive, almost into the middle of my third volume
(According to the preceding Editions.)--and no farther than to my first
day's life--'tis demonstrative that I have three hundred and sixty-four
days more life to write just now, than when I first set out; so that
instead of advancing, as a common writer, in my work with what I have been
doing at it--on the contrary, I am just thrown so many volumes back--was
every day of my life to be as busy a day as this--And why not?--and the
transactions and opinions of it to take up as much description--And for
what reason should they be cut short? as at this rate I should just live
364 times faster than I should write--It must follow, an' please your
worships, that the more I write, the more I shall have to write--and
consequently, the more your worships read, the more your worships will have
to read.
Will this be good for your worships eyes?
It will do well for mine; and, was it not that my Opinions will be the
death of me, I perceive I shall lead a fine life of it out of this self-
same life of mine; or, in other words, shall lead a couple of fine lives
together.
As for the proposal of twelve volumes a year, or a volume a month, it no
way alters my prospect--write as I will, and rush as I may into the middle
of things, as Horace advises--I shall never overtake myself whipp'd and
driven to the last pinch; at the worst I shall have one day the start of my
pen--and one day is enough for two volumes--and two volumes will be enough
for one year.--
Heaven prosper the manufacturers of paper under this propitious reign,
which is now opened to us--as I trust its providence will prosper every
thing else in it that is taken in hand.
As for the propagation of Geese--I give myself no concern--Nature is all-
bountiful--I shall never want tools to work with.
--So then, friend! you have got my father and my uncle Toby off the stairs,
and seen them to bed?--And how did you manage it?--You dropp'd a curtain at
the stair-foot--I thought you had no other way for it--Here's a crown for
your trouble.
Chapter 2.XLIX.
--Then reach me my breeches off the chair, said my father to Susannah.--
There is not a moment's time to dress you, Sir, cried Susannah--the child
is as black in the face as my--As your what? said my father, for like all
orators, he was a dear searcher into comparisons.--Bless, me, Sir, said
Susannah, the child's in a fit.--And where's Mr. Yorick?--Never where he
should be, said Susannah, but his curate's in the dressing-room, with the
child upon his arm, waiting for the name--and my mistress bid me run as
fast as I could to know, as captain Shandy is the godfather, whether it
should not be called after him.
Were one sure, said my father to himself, scratching his eye-brow, that the
child was expiring, one might as well compliment my brother Toby as not--
and it would be a pity, in such a case, to throw away so great a name as
Trismegistus upon him--but he may recover.
No, no,--said my father to Susannah, I'll get up--There is no time, cried
Susannah, the child's as black as my shoe. Trismegistus, said my father--
But stay--thou art a leaky vessel, Susannah, added my father; canst thou
carry Trismegistus in thy head, the length of the gallery without
scattering?--Can I? cried Susannah, shutting the door in a huff.--If she
can, I'll be shot, said my father, bouncing out of bed in the dark, and
groping for his breeches.
Susannah ran with all speed along the gallery.
My father made all possible speed to find his breeches.
Susannah got the start, and kept it--'Tis Tris--something, cried Susannah--
There is no christian-name in the world, said the curate, beginning with
Tris--but Tristram. Then 'tis Tristram-gistus, quoth Susannah.
--There is no gistus to it, noodle!--'tis my own name, replied the curate,
dipping his hand, as he spoke, into the bason--Tristram! said he, &c. &c.
&c. &c.--so Tristram was I called, and Tristram shall I be to the day of my
death.
My father followed Susannah, with his night-gown across his arm, with
nothing more than his breeches on, fastened through haste with but a single
button, and that button through haste thrust only half into the button-
hole.
--She has not forgot the name, cried my father, half opening the door?--No,
no, said the curate, with a tone of intelligence.--And the child is better,
cried Susannah.--And how does your mistress? As well, said Susannah, as
can be expected.--Pish! said my father, the button of his breeches slipping
out of the button-hole--So that whether the interjection was levelled at
Susannah, or the button-hole--whether Pish was an interjection of contempt
or an interjection of modesty, is a doubt, and must be a doubt till I shall
have time to write the three following favourite chapters, that is, my
chapter of chamber-maids, my chapter of pishes, and my chapter of button-
holes.
All the light I am able to give the reader at present is this, that the
moment my father cried Pish! he whisk'd himself about--and with his
breeches held up by one hand, and his night-gown thrown across the arm of
the other, he turned along the gallery to bed, something slower than he
came.
Chapter 2.L.
I wish I could write a chapter upon sleep.
A fitter occasion could never have presented itself, than what this moment
offers, when all the curtains of the family are drawn--the candles put out-
-and no creature's eyes are open but a single one, for the other has been
shut these twenty years, of my mother's nurse.
It is a fine subject.
And yet, as fine as it is, I would undertake to write a dozen chapters upon
button-holes, both quicker and with more fame, than a single chapter upon
this.
Button-holes! there is something lively in the very idea of 'em--and trust
me, when I get amongst 'em--You gentry with great beards--look as grave as
you will--I'll make merry work with my button-holes--I shall have 'em all
to myself--'tis a maiden subject--I shall run foul of no man's wisdom or
fine sayings in it.
But for sleep--I know I shall make nothing of it before I begin--I am no
dab at your fine sayings in the first place--and in the next, I cannot for
my soul set a grave face upon a bad matter, and tell the world--'tis the
refuge of the unfortunate--the enfranchisement of the prisoner--the downy
lap of the hopeless, the weary, and the broken-hearted; nor could I set out
with a lye in my mouth, by affirming, that of all the soft and delicious
functions of our nature, by which the great Author of it, in his bounty,
has been pleased to recompence the sufferings wherewith his justice and his
good pleasure has wearied us--that this is the chiefest (I know pleasures
worth ten of it); or what a happiness it is to man, when the anxieties and
passions of the day are over, and he lies down upon his back, that his soul
shall be so seated within him, that whichever way she turns her eyes, the
heavens shall look calm and sweet above her--no desire--or fear--or doubt
that troubles the air, nor any difficulty past, present, or to come, that
the imagination may not pass over without offence, in that sweet secession.
'God's blessing,' said Sancho Panca, 'be upon the man who first invented
this self-same thing called sleep--it covers a man all over like a cloak.' 
Now there is more to me in this, and it speaks warmer to my heart and
affections, than all the dissertations squeez'd out of the heads of the
learned together upon the subject.
--Not that I altogether disapprove of what Montaigne advances upon it--'tis
admirable in its way--(I quote by memory.)
The world enjoys other pleasures, says he, as they do that of sleep,
without tasting or feeling it as it slips and passes by.--We should study
and ruminate upon it, in order to render proper thanks to him who grants it
to us.--For this end I cause myself to be disturbed in my sleep, that I may
the better and more sensibly relish it.--And yet I see few, says he again,
who live with less sleep, when need requires; my body is capable of a firm,
but not of a violent and sudden agitation--I evade of late all violent
exercises--I am never weary with walking--but from my youth, I never looked
to ride upon pavements. I love to lie hard and alone, and even without my
wife--This last word may stagger the faith of the world--but remember, 'La
Vraisemblance' (as Bayle says in the affair of Liceti) 'n'est pas toujours
du Cote de la Verite.' And so much for sleep.
Chapter 2.LI.
If my wife will but venture him--brother Toby, Trismegistus shall be
dress'd and brought down to us, whilst you and I are getting our breakfasts
together.--
--Go, tell Susannah, Obadiah, to step here.
She is run up stairs, answered Obadiah, this very instant, sobbing and
crying, and wringing her hands as if her heart would break.
We shall have a rare month of it, said my father, turning his head from
Obadiah, and looking wistfully in my uncle Toby's face for some time--we
shall have a devilish month of it, brother Toby, said my father, setting
his arms a'kimbo, and shaking his head; fire, water, women, wind--brother
Toby!--'Tis some misfortune, quoth my uncle Toby.--That it is, cried my
father--to have so many jarring elements breaking loose, and riding triumph
in every corner of a gentleman's house--Little boots it to the peace of a
family, brother Toby, that you and I possess ourselves, and sit here silent
and unmoved--whilst such a storm is whistling over our heads.--
And what's the matter, Susannah? They have called the child Tristram--and
my mistress is just got out of an hysterick fit about it--No!--'tis not my
fault, said Susannah--I told him it was Tristram-gistus.
--Make tea for yourself, brother Toby, said my father, taking down his hat-
-but how different from the sallies and agitations of voice and members
which a common reader would imagine!
--For he spake in the sweetest modulation--and took down his hat with the
genteelest movement of limbs, that ever affliction harmonized and attuned
together.
--Go to the bowling-green for corporal Trim, said my uncle Toby, speaking
to Obadiah, as soon as my father left the room.
Chapter 2.LII.
When the misfortune of my Nose fell so heavily upon my father's head;--the
reader remembers that he walked instantly up stairs, and cast himself down
upon his bed; and from hence, unless he has a great insight into human
nature, he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same ascending and
descending movements from him, upon this misfortune of my Name;--no.
The different weight, dear Sir--nay even the different package of two
vexations of the same weight--makes a very wide difference in our manner of
bearing and getting through with them.--It is not half an hour ago, when
(in the great hurry and precipitation of a poor devil's writing for daily
bread) I threw a fair sheet, which I had just finished, and carefully wrote
out, slap into the fire, instead of the foul one.
Instantly I snatch'd off my wig, and threw it perpendicularly, with all
imaginable violence, up to the top of the room--indeed I caught it as it
fell--but there was an end of the matter; nor do I think any think else in
Nature would have given such immediate ease: She, dear Goddess, by an
instantaneous impulse, in all provoking cases, determines us to a sally of
this or that member--or else she thrusts us into this or that place, or
posture of body, we know not why--But mark, madam, we live amongst riddles
and mysteries--the most obvious things, which come in our way, have dark
sides, which the quickest sight cannot penetrate into; and even the
clearest and most exalted understandings amongst us find ourselves puzzled
and at a loss in almost every cranny of nature's works: so that this, like
a thousand other things, falls out for us in a way, which tho' we cannot
reason upon it--yet we find the good of it, may it please your reverences
and your worships--and that's enough for us.
Now, my father could not lie down with this affliction for his life--nor
could he carry it up stairs like the other--he walked composedly out with
it to the fish-pond.
Had my father leaned his head upon his hand, and reasoned an hour which way
to have gone--reason, with all her force, could not have directed him to
any think like it: there is something, Sir, in fish-ponds--but what it is,
I leave to system-builders and fish-pond-diggers betwixt 'em to find out--
but there is something, under the first disorderly transport of the
humours, so unaccountably becalming in an orderly and a sober walk towards
one of them, that I have often wondered that neither Pythagoras, nor Plato,
nor Solon, nor Lycurgus, nor Mahomet, nor any one of your noted lawgivers,
ever gave order about them.
Chapter 2.LIII.
Your honour, said Trim, shutting the parlour-door before he began to speak,
has heard, I imagine, of this unlucky accident--O yes, Trim, said my uncle
Toby, and it gives me great concern.--I am heartily concerned too, but I
hope your honour, replied Trim, will do me the justice to believe, that it
was not in the least owing to me.--To thee--Trim?--cried my uncle Toby,
looking kindly in his face--'twas Susannah's and the curate's folly betwixt
them.--What business could they have together, an' please your honour, in
the garden?--In the gallery thou meanest, replied my uncle Toby.
Trim found he was upon a wrong scent, and stopped short with a low bow--Two
misfortunes, quoth the corporal to himself, are twice as many at least as
are needful to be talked over at one time;--the mischief the cow has done
in breaking into the fortifications, may be told his honour hereafter.--
Trim's casuistry and address, under the cover of his low bow, prevented all
suspicion in my uncle Toby, so he went on with what he had to say to Trim
as follows:
--For my own part, Trim, though I can see little or no difference betwixt
my nephew's being called Tristram or Trismegistus--yet as the thing sits so
near my brother's heart, Trim--I would freely have given a hundred pounds
rather than it should have happened.--A hundred pounds, an' please your
honour! replied Trim,--I would not give a cherry-stone to boot.--Nor would
I, Trim, upon my own account, quoth my uncle Toby--but my brother, whom
there is no arguing with in this case--maintains that a great deal more
depends, Trim, upon christian-names, than what ignorant people imagine--for
he says there never was a great or heroic action performed since the world
began by one called Tristram--nay, he will have it, Trim, that a man can
neither be learned, or wise, or brave.--'Tis all fancy, an' please your
honour--I fought just as well, replied the corporal, when the regiment
called me Trim, as when they called me James Butler.--And for my own part,
said my uncle Toby, though I should blush to boast of myself, Trim--yet had
my name been Alexander, I could have done no more at Namur than my duty.--
Bless your honour! cried Trim, advancing three steps as he spoke, does a
man think of his christian-name when he goes upon the attack?--Or when he
stands in the trench, Trim? cried my uncle Toby, looking firm.--Or when he
enters a breach? said Trim, pushing in between two chairs.--Or forces the
lines? cried my uncle, rising up, and pushing his crutch like a pike.--Or
facing a platoon? cried Trim, presenting his stick like a firelock.--Or
when he marches up the glacis? cried my uncle Toby, looking warm and
setting his foot upon his stool.--
Chapter 2.LIV.
My father was returned from his walk to the fish-pond--and opened the
parlour-door in the very height of the attack, just as my uncle Toby was
marching up the glacis--Trim recovered his arms--never was my uncle Toby
caught in riding at such a desperate rate in his life! Alas! my uncle Toby!
had not a weightier matter called forth all the ready eloquence of my
father--how hadst thou then and thy poor Hobby-Horse too been insulted!
My father hung up his hat with the same air he took it down; and after
giving a slight look at the disorder of the room, he took hold of one of
the chairs which had formed the corporal's breach, and placing it over-
against my uncle Toby, he sat down in it, and as soon as the tea-things
were taken away, and the door shut, he broke out in a lamentation as
follows:
My Father's Lamentation.
It is in vain longer, said my father, addressing himself as much to
Ernulphus's curse, which was laid upon the corner of the chimney-piece--as
to my uncle Toby who sat under it--it is in vain longer, said my father, in
the most querulous monotony imaginable, to struggle as I have done against
this most uncomfortable of human persuasions--I see it plainly, that either
for my own sins, brother Toby, or the sins and follies of the Shandy
family, Heaven has thought fit to draw forth the heaviest of its artillery
against me; and that the prosperity of my child is the point upon which the
whole force of it is directed to play.--Such a thing would batter the whole
universe about our ears, brother Shandy, said my uncle Toby--if it was so-
Unhappy Tristram! child of wrath! child of decrepitude! interruption!
mistake! and discontent! What one misfortune or disaster in the book of
embryotic evils, that could unmechanize thy frame, or entangle thy
filaments! which has not fallen upon thy head, or ever thou camest into the
world--what evils in thy passage into it!--what evils since!--produced into
being, in the decline of thy father's days--when the powers of his
imagination and of his body were waxing feeble--when radical heat and
radical moisture, the elements which should have temper'd thine, were
drying up; and nothing left to found thy stamina in, but negations--'tis
pitiful--brother Toby, at the best, and called out for all the little helps
that care and attention on both sides could give it. But how were we
defeated! You know the event, brother Toby--'tis too melancholy a one to
be repeated now--when the few animal spirits I was worth in the world, and
with which memory, fancy, and quick parts should have been convey'd--were
all dispersed, confused, confounded, scattered, and sent to the devil.--
Here then was the time to have put a stop to this persecution against him;-
-and tried an experiment at least--whether calmness and serenity of mind in
your sister, with a due attention, brother Toby, to her evacuations and
repletions--and the rest of her non-naturals, might not, in a course of
nine months gestation, have set all things to rights.--My child was bereft
of these!--What a teazing life did she lead herself, and consequently her
foetus too, with that nonsensical anxiety of hers about lying-in in town? 
I thought my sister submitted with the greatest patience, replied my uncle
Toby--I never heard her utter one fretful word about it.--She fumed
inwardly, cried my father; and that, let me tell you, brother, was ten
times worse for the child--and then! what battles did she fight with me,
and what perpetual storms about the midwife.--There she gave vent, said my
uncle Toby.--Vent! cried my father, looking up.
But what was all this, my dear Toby, to the injuries done us by my child's
coming head foremost into the world, when all I wished, in this general
wreck of his frame, was to have saved this little casket unbroke,
unrifled.--
With all my precautions, how was my system turned topside-turvy in the womb
with my child! his head exposed to the hand of violence, and a pressure of
470 pounds avoirdupois weight acting so perpendicularly upon its apex--that
at this hour 'tis ninety per Cent. insurance, that the fine net-work of the
intellectual web be not rent and torn to a thousand tatters.
--Still we could have done.--Fool, coxcomb, puppy--give him but a Nose--
Cripple, Dwarf, Driveller, Goosecap--(shape him as you will) the door of
fortune stands open--O Licetus! Licetus! had I been blest with a foetus
five inches long and a half, like thee--Fate might have done her worst.
Still, brother Toby, there was one cast of the dye left for our child after
all--O Tristram! Tristram! Tristram!
We will send for Mr. Yorick, said my uncle Toby.
--You may send for whom you will, replied my father.
Chapter 2.LV.
What a rate have I gone on at, curvetting and striking it away, two up and
two down for three volumes (According to the preceding Editions.) together,
without looking once behind, or even on one side of me, to see whom I trod
upon!--I'll tread upon no one--quoth I to myself when I mounted--I'll take
a good rattling gallop; but I'll not hurt the poorest jack-ass upon the
road.--So off I set--up one lane--down another, through this turnpike--over
that, as if the arch-jockey of jockeys had got behind me.
Now ride at this rate with what good intention and resolution you may--'tis
a million to one you'll do some one a mischief, if not yourself--He's
flung--he's off--he's lost his hat--he's down--he'll break his neck--see!--
if he has not galloped full among the scaffolding of the undertaking
criticks!--he'll knock his brains out against some of their posts--he's
bounced out!--look--he's now riding like a mad-cap full tilt through a
whole crowd of painters, fiddlers, poets, biographers, physicians, lawyers,
logicians, players, school-men, churchmen, statesmen, soldiers, casuists,
connoisseurs, prelates, popes, and engineers.--Don't fear, said I--I'll not
hurt the poorest jack-ass upon the king's highway.--But your horse throws
dirt; see you've splash'd a bishop--I hope in God, 'twas only Ernulphus,
said I.--But you have squirted full in the faces of Mess. Le Moyne, De
Romigny, and De Marcilly, doctors of the Sorbonne.--That was last year,
replied I.--But you have trod this moment upon a king.--Kings have bad
times on't, said I, to be trod upon by such people as me.
You have done it, replied my accuser.
I deny it, quoth I, and so have got off, and here am I standing with my
bridle in one hand, and with my cap in the other, to tell my story.--And
what in it? You shall hear in the next chapter.
Chapter 2.LVI.
As Francis the first of France was one winterly night warming himself over
the embers of a wood fire, and talking with his first minister of sundry
things for the good of the state (Vide Menagiana, Vol. I.)--It would not be
amiss, said the king, stirring up the embers with his cane, if this good
understanding betwixt ourselves and Switzerland was a little strengthened.-
-There is no end, Sire, replied the minister, in giving money to these
people--they would swallow up the treasury of France.--Poo! poo! answered
the king--there are more ways, Mons. le Premier, of bribing states, besides
that of giving money--I'll pay Switzerland the honour of standing godfather
for my next child.--Your majesty, said the minister, in so doing, would
have all the grammarians in Europe upon your back;--Switzerland, as a
republic, being a female, can in no construction be godfather.--She may be
godmother, replied Francis hastily--so announce my intentions by a courier
to-morrow morning.
I am astonished, said Francis the First, (that day fortnight) speaking to
his minister as he entered the closet, that we have had no answer from
Switzerland.--Sire, I wait upon you this moment, said Mons. le Premier, to
lay before you my dispatches upon that business.--They take it kindly, said
the king.--They do, Sire, replied the minister, and have the highest sense
of the honour your majesty has done them--but the republick, as godmother,
claims her right, in this case, of naming the child.
In all reason, quoth the king--she will christen him Francis, or Henry, or
Lewis, or some name that she knows will be agreeable to us. Your majesty
is deceived, replied the minister--I have this hour received a dispatch
from our resident, with the determination of the republic on that point
also.--And what name has the republick fixed upon for the Dauphin?--
Shadrach, Mesech, Abed-nego, replied the minister.--By Saint Peter's
girdle, I will have nothing to do with the Swiss, cried Francis the First,
pulling up his breeches and walking hastily across the floor.
Your majesty, replied the minister calmly, cannot bring yourself off.
We'll pay them in money--said the king.
Sire, there are not sixty thousand crowns in the treasury, answered the
minister.--I'll pawn the best jewel in my crown, quoth Francis the First.
Your honour stands pawn'd already in this matter, answered Monsieur le
Premier.
Then, Mons. le Premier, said the king, by. . .we'll go to war with 'em.
Chapter 2.LVII.
Albeit, gentle reader, I have lusted earnestly, and endeavoured carefully
(according to the measure of such a slender skill as God has vouchsafed me,
and as convenient leisure from other occasions of needful profit and
healthful pastime have permitted) that these little books which I here put
into thy hands, might stand instead of many bigger books--yet have I
carried myself towards thee in such fanciful guise of careless disport,
that right sore am I ashamed now to intreat thy lenity seriously--in
beseeching thee to believe it of me, that in the story of my father and his
christian-names--I have no thoughts of treading upon Francis the First--nor
in the affair of the nose--upon Francis the Ninth--nor in the character of
my uncle Toby--of characterizing the militiating spirits of my country--the
wound upon his groin, is a wound to every comparison of that kind--nor by
Trim--that I meant the duke of Ormond--or that my book is wrote against
predestination, or free-will, or taxes--If 'tis wrote against any thing,--
'tis wrote, an' please your worships, against the spleen! in order, by a
more frequent and a more convulsive elevation and depression of the
diaphragm, and the succussations of the intercostal and abdominal muscles
in laughter, to drive the gall and other bitter juices from the gall-
bladder, liver, and sweet-bread of his majesty's subjects, with all the
inimicitious passions which belong to them, down into their duodenums.
Chapter 2.LVIII.
--But can the thing be undone, Yorick? said my father--for in my opinion,
continued he, it cannot. I am a vile canonist, replied Yorick--but of all
evils, holding suspence to be the most tormenting, we shall at least know
the worst of this matter. I hate these great dinners--said my father--The
size of the dinner is not the point, answered Yorick--we want, Mr. Shandy,
to dive into the bottom of this doubt, whether the name can be changed or
not--and as the beards of so many commissaries, officials, advocates,
proctors, registers, and of the most eminent of our school-divines, and
others, are all to meet in the middle of one table, and Didius has so
pressingly invited you--who in your distress would miss such an occasion? 
All that is requisite, continued Yorick, is to apprize Didius, and let him
manage a conversation after dinner so as to introduce the subject.--Then my
brother Toby, cried my father, clapping his two hands together, shall go
with us.
--Let my old tye-wig, quoth my uncle Toby, and my laced regimentals, be
hung to the fire all night, Trim.

Chapter 2.LX.
--No doubt, Sir,--there is a whole chapter wanting here--and a chasm of ten
pages made in the book by it--but the book-binder is neither a fool, or a
knave, or a puppy--nor is the book a jot more imperfect (at least upon that
score)--but, on the contrary, the book is more perfect and complete by
wanting the chapter, than having it, as I shall demonstrate to your
reverences in this manner.--I question first, by-the-bye, whether the same
experiment might not be made as successfully upon sundry other chapters--
but there is no end, an' please your reverences, in trying experiments upon
chapters--we have had enough of it--So there's an end of that matter.
But before I begin my demonstration, let me only tell you, that the chapter
which I have torn out, and which otherwise you would all have been reading
just now, instead of this--was the description of my father's, my uncle
Toby's, Trim's, and Obadiah's setting out and journeying to the visitation
at. . ..
We'll go in the coach, said my father--Prithee, have the arms been altered,
Obadiah?--It would have made my story much better to have begun with
telling you, that at the time my mother's arms were added to the Shandy's,
when the coach was re-painted upon my father's marriage, it had so fallen
out that the coach-painter, whether by performing all his works with the
left hand, like Turpilius the Roman, or Hans Holbein of Basil--or whether
'twas more from the blunder of his head than hand--or whether, lastly, it
was from the sinister turn which every thing relating to our family was apt
to take--it so fell out, however, to our reproach, that instead of the
bend-dexter, which since Harry the Eighth's reign was honestly our due--a
bend-sinister, by some of these fatalities, had been drawn quite across the
field of the Shandy arms. 'Tis scarce credible that the mind of so wise a
man as my father was, could be so much incommoded with so small a matter. 
The word coach--let it be whose it would--or coach-man, or coach-horse, or
coach-hire, could never be named in the family, but he constantly
complained of carrying this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his
own; he never once was able to step into the coach, or out of it, without
turning round to take a view of the arms, and making a vow at the same
time, that it was the last time he would ever set his foot in it again,
till the bend-sinister was taken out--but like the affair of the hinge, it
was one of the many things which the Destinies had set down in their books
ever to be grumbled at (and in wiser families than ours)--but never to be
mended.
--Has the bend-sinister been brush'd out, I say? said my father.--There has
been nothing brush'd out, Sir, answered Obadiah, but the lining. We'll go
o'horseback, said my father, turning to Yorick--Of all things in the world,
except politicks, the clergy know the least of heraldry, said Yorick.--No
matter for that, cried my father--I should be sorry to appear with a blot
in my escutcheon before them.--Never mind the bend-sinister, said my uncle
Toby, putting on his tye-wig.--No, indeed, said my father--you may go with
my aunt Dinah to a visitation with a bend-sinister, if you think fit--My
poor uncle Toby blush'd. My father was vexed at himself.--No--my dear
brother Toby, said my father, changing his tone--but the damp of the coach-
lining about my loins, may give me the sciatica again, as it did December,
January, and February last winter--so if you please you shall ride my
wife's pad--and as you are to preach, Yorick, you had better make the best
of your way before--and leave me to take care of my brother Toby, and to
follow at our own rates.
Now the chapter I was obliged to tear out, was the description of this
cavalcade, in which Corporal Trim and Obadiah, upon two coach-horses a-
breast, led the way as slow as a patrole--whilst my uncle Toby, in his
laced regimentals and tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep roads
and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and arms, as
each could get the start.
--But the painting of this journey, upon reviewing it, appears to be so
much above the stile and manner of any thing else I have been able to paint
in this book, that it could not have remained in it, without depreciating
every other scene; and destroying at the same time that necessary equipoise
and balance, (whether of good or bad) betwixt chapter and chapter, from
whence the just proportions and harmony of the whole work results. For my
own part, I am but just set up in the business, so know little about it--
but, in my opinion, to write a book is for all the world like humming a
song--be but in tune with yourself, madam, 'tis no matter how high or how
low you take it.
--This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that some of the
lowest and flattest compositions pass off very well--(as Yorick told my
uncle Toby one night) by siege.--My uncle Toby looked brisk at the sound of
the word siege, but could make neither head or tail of it.
I'm to preach at court next Sunday, said Homenas--run over my notes--so I
humm'd over doctor Homenas's notes--the modulation's very well--'twill do,
Homenas, if it holds on at this rate--so on I humm'd--and a tolerable tune
I thought it was; and to this hour, may it please your reverences, had
never found out how low, how flat, how spiritless and jejune it was, but
that all of a sudden, up started an air in the middle of it, so fine, so
rich, so heavenly,--it carried my soul up with it into the other world; now
had I (as Montaigne complained in a parallel accident)--had I found the
declivity easy, or the ascent accessible--certes I had been outwitted.--
Your notes, Homenas, I should have said, are good notes;--but it was so
perpendicular a precipice--so wholly cut off from the rest of the work,
that by the first note I humm'd I found myself flying into the other world,
and from thence discovered the vale from whence I came, so deep, so low,
and dismal, that I shall never have the heart to descend into it again.
> A dwarf who brings a standard along with him to measure his own size--
take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than one.--And so much for
tearing out of chapters.
Chapter 2.LXI.
--See if he is not cutting it into slips, and giving them about him to
light their pipes!--'Tis abominable, answered Didius; it should not go
unnoticed, said doctor Kysarcius--> he was of the Kysarcii of the Low
Countries.
Methinks, said Didius, half rising from his chair, in order to remove a
bottle and a tall decanter, which stood in a direct line betwixt him and
Yorick--you might have spared this sarcastic stroke, and have hit upon a
more proper place, Mr. Yorick--or at least upon a more proper occasion to
have shewn your contempt of what we have been about: If the sermon is of
no better worth than to light pipes with--'twas certainly, Sir, not good
enough to be preached before so learned a body; and if 'twas good enough to
be preached before so learned a body--'twas certainly Sir, too good to
light their pipes with afterwards.
--I have got him fast hung up, quoth Didius to himself, upon one of the two
horns of my dilemma--let him get off as he can.
I have undergone such unspeakable torments, in bringing forth this sermon,
quoth Yorick, upon this occasion--that I declare, Didius, I would suffer
martyrdom--and if it was possible my horse with me, a thousand times over,
before I would sit down and make such another: I was delivered of it at
the wrong end of me--it came from my head instead of my heart--and it is
for the pain it gave me, both in the writing and preaching of it, that I
revenge myself of it, in this manner--To preach, to shew the extent of our
reading, or the subtleties of our wit--to parade in the eyes of the vulgar
with the beggarly accounts of a little learning, tinsel'd over with a few
words which glitter, but convey little light and less warmth--is a
dishonest use of the poor single half hour in a week which is put into our
hands--'Tis not preaching the gospel--but ourselves--For my own part,
continued Yorick, I had rather direct five words point-blank to the heart.-
-
As Yorick pronounced the word point-blank, my uncle Toby rose up to say
something upon projectiles--when a single word and no more uttered from the
opposite side of the table drew every one's ears towards it--a word of all
others in the dictionary the last in that place to be expected--a word I am
ashamed to write--yet must be written--must be read--illegal--uncanonical--
guess ten thousand guesses, multiplied into themselves--rack--torture your
invention for ever, you're where you was--In short, I'll tell it in the
next chapter.
Chapter 2.LXII.
Zounds!--Z...ds! cried Phutatorius, partly to himself--and yet high enough
to be heard--and what seemed odd, 'twas uttered in a construction of look,
and in a tone of voice, somewhat between that of a man in amazement and one
in bodily pain.
One or two who had very nice ears, and could distinguish the expression and
mixture of the two tones as plainly as a third or a fifth, or any other
chord in musick--were the most puzzled and perplexed with it--the concord
was good in itself--but then 'twas quite out of the key, and no way
applicable to the subject started;--so that with all their knowledge, they
could not tell what in the world to make of it.
Others who knew nothing of musical expression, and merely lent their ears
to the plain import of the word, imagined that Phutatorius, who was
somewhat of a cholerick spirit, was just going to snatch the cudgels out of
Didius's hands, in order to bemaul Yorick to some purpose--and that the
desperate monosyllable Z...ds was the exordium to an oration, which, as
they judged from the sample, presaged but a rough kind of handling of him;
so that my uncle Toby's good-nature felt a pang for what Yorick was about
to undergo. But seeing Phutatorius stop short, without any attempt or
desire to go on--a third party began to suppose, that it was no more than
an involuntary respiration, casually forming itself into the shape of a
twelve-penny oath--without the sin or substance of one.
Others, and especially one or two who sat next him, looked upon it on the
contrary as a real and substantial oath, propensly formed against Yorick,
to whom he was known to bear no good liking--which said oath, as my father
philosophized upon it, actually lay fretting and fuming at that very time
in the upper regions of Phutatorius's purtenance; and so was naturally, and
according to the due course of things, first squeezed out by the sudden
influx of blood which was driven into the right ventricle of Phutatorius's
heart, by the stroke of surprize which so strange a theory of preaching had
excited.
How finely we argue upon mistaken facts!
There was not a soul busied in all these various reasonings upon the
monosyllable which Phutatorius uttered--who did not take this for granted,
proceeding upon it as from an axiom, namely, that Phutatorius's mind was
intent upon the subject of debate which was arising between Didius and
Yorick; and indeed as he looked first towards the one and then towards the
other, with the air of a man listening to what was going forwards--who
would not have thought the same? But the truth was, that Phutatorius knew
not one word or one syllable of what was passing--but his whole thoughts
and attention were taken up with a transaction which was going forwards at
that very instant within the precincts of his own Galligaskins, and in a
part of them, where of all others he stood most interested to watch
accidents: So that notwithstanding he looked with all the attention in the
world, and had gradually skrewed up every nerve and muscle in his face, to
the utmost pitch the instrument would bear, in order, as it was thought, to
give a sharp reply to Yorick, who sat over-against him--yet, I say, was
Yorick never once in any one domicile of Phutatorius's brain--but the true
cause of his exclamation lay at least a yard below. 
This I will endeavour to explain to you with all imaginable decency.
You must be informed then, that Gastripheres, who had taken a turn into the
kitchen a little before dinner, to see how things went on--observing a
wicker-basket of fine chesnuts standing upon the dresser, had ordered that
a hundred or two of them might be roasted and sent in, as soon as dinner
was over--Gastripheres inforcing his orders about them, that Didius, but
Phutatorius especially, were particularly fond of 'em.
About two minutes before the time that my uncle Toby interrupted Yorick's
harangue--Gastripheres's chesnuts were brought in--and as Phutatorius's
fondness for 'em was uppermost in the waiter's head, he laid them directly
before Phutatorius, wrapt up hot in a clean damask napkin.
Now whether it was physically impossible, with half a dozen hands all
thrust into the napkin at a time--but that some one chesnut, of more life
and rotundity than the rest, must be put in motion--it so fell out,
however, that one was actually sent rolling off the table; and as
Phutatorius sat straddling under--it fell perpendicularly into that
particular aperture of Phutatorius's breeches, for which, to the shame and
indelicacy of our language be it spoke, there is no chaste word throughout
all Johnson's dictionary--let it suffice to say--it was that particular
aperture which, in all good societies, the laws of decorum do strictly
require, like the temple of Janus (in peace at least) to be universally
shut up.
The neglect of this punctilio in Phutatorius (which by-the-bye should be a
warning to all mankind) had opened a door to this accident.--
Accident I call it, in compliance to a received mode of speaking--but in no
opposition to the opinion either of Acrites or Mythogeras in this matter; I
know they were both prepossessed and fully persuaded of it--and are so to
this hour, That there was nothing of accident in the whole event--but that
the chesnut's taking that particular course, and in a manner of its own
accord--and then falling with all its heat directly into that one
particular place, and no other--was a real judgment upon Phutatorius for
that filthy and obscene treatise de Concubinis retinendis, which
Phutatorius had published about twenty years ago--and was that identical
week going to give the world a second edition of.
It is not my business to dip my pen in this controversy--much undoubtedly
may be wrote on both sides of the question--all that concerns me as an
historian, is to represent the matter of fact, and render it credible to
the reader, that the hiatus in Phutatorius's breeches was sufficiently wide
to receive the chesnut;--and that the chesnut, somehow or other, did fall
perpendicularly, and piping hot into it, without Phutatorius's perceiving
it, or any one else at that time.
The genial warmth which the chesnut imparted, was not undelectable for the
first twenty or five-and-twenty seconds--and did no more than gently
solicit Phutatorius's attention towards the part:--But the heat gradually
increasing, and in a few seconds more getting beyond the point of all sober
pleasure, and then advancing with all speed into the regions of pain, the
soul of Phutatorius, together with all his ideas, his thoughts, his
attention, his imagination, judgment, resolution, deliberation,
ratiocination, memory, fancy, with ten battalions of animal spirits, all
tumultuously crowded down, through different defiles and circuits, to the
place of danger, leaving all his upper regions, as you may imagine, as
empty as my purse.
With the best intelligence which all these messengers could bring him back,
Phutatorius was not able to dive into the secret of what was going forwards
below, nor could he make any kind of conjecture, what the devil was the
matter with it: However, as he knew not what the true cause might turn
out, he deemed it most prudent in the situation he was in at present, to
bear it, if possible, like a Stoick; which, with the help of some wry faces
and compursions of the mouth, he had certainly accomplished, had his
imagination continued neuter;--but the sallies of the imagination are
ungovernable in things of this kind--a thought instantly darted into his
mind, that tho' the anguish had the sensation of glowing heat--it might,
notwithstanding that, be a bite as well as a burn; and if so, that possibly
a Newt or an Asker, or some such detested reptile, had crept up, and was
fastening his teeth--the horrid idea of which, with a fresh glow of pain
arising that instant from the chesnut, seized Phutatorius with a sudden
panick, and in the first terrifying disorder of the passion, it threw him,
as it has done the best generals upon earth, quite off his guard:--the
effect of which was this, that he leapt incontinently up, uttering as he
rose that interjection of surprise so much descanted upon, with the
aposiopestic break after it, marked thus, Z...ds--which, though not
strictly canonical, was still as little as any man could have said upon the
occasion;--and which, by-the-bye, whether canonical or not, Phutatorius
could no more help than he could the cause of it.
Though this has taken up some time in the narrative, it took up little more
time in the transaction, than just to allow time for Phutatorius to draw
forth the chesnut, and throw it down with violence upon the floor--and for
Yorick to rise from his chair, and pick the chesnut up.
It is curious to observe the triumph of slight incidents over the mind:--
What incredible weight they have in forming and governing our opinions,
both of men and things--that trifles, light as air, shall waft a belief
into the soul, and plant it so immoveably within it--that Euclid's
demonstrations, could they be brought to batter it in breach, should not
all have power to overthrow it.
Yorick, I said, picked up the chesnut which Phutatorius's wrath had flung
down--the action was trifling--I am ashamed to account for it--he did it,
for no reason, but that he thought the chesnut not a jot worse for the
adventure--and that he held a good chesnut worth stooping for.--But this
incident, trifling as it was, wrought differently in Phutatorius's head: 
He considered this act of Yorick's in getting off his chair and picking up
the chesnut, as a plain acknowledgment in him, that the chesnut was
originally his--and in course, that it must have been the owner of the
chesnut, and no one else, who could have played him such a prank with it: 
What greatly confirmed him in this opinion, was this, that the table being
parallelogramical and very narrow, it afforded a fair opportunity for
Yorick, who sat directly over against Phutatorius, of slipping the chesnut
in--and consequently that he did it. The look of something more than
suspicion, which Phutatorius cast full upon Yorick as these thoughts arose,
too evidently spoke his opinion--and as Phutatorius was naturally supposed
to know more of the matter than any person besides, his opinion at once
became the general one;--and for a reason very different from any which
have been yet given--in a little time it was put out of all manner of
dispute.
When great or unexpected events fall out upon the stage of this sublunary
world--the mind of man, which is an inquisitive kind of a substance,
naturally takes a flight behind the scenes to see what is the cause and
first spring of them.--The search was not long in this instance.
It was well known that Yorick had never a good opinion of the treatise
which Phutatorius had wrote de Concubinis retinendis, as a thing which he
feared had done hurt in the world--and 'twas easily found out, that there
was a mystical meaning in Yorick's prank--and that his chucking the chesnut
hot into Phutatorius's. . .--. . ., was a sarcastical fling at his book--
the doctrines of which, they said, had enflamed many an honest man in the
same place.
This conceit awaken'd Somnolentus--made Agelastes smile--and if you can
recollect the precise look and air of a man's face intent in finding out a
riddle--it threw Gastripheres's into that form--and in short was thought by
many to be a master-stroke of arch-wit.
This, as the reader has seen from one end to the other, was as groundless
as the dreams of philosophy: Yorick, no doubt, as Shakespeare said of his
ancestor--'was a man of jest,' but it was temper'd with something which
withheld him from that, and many other ungracious pranks, of which he as
undeservedly bore the blame;--but it was his misfortune all his life long
to bear the imputation of saying and doing a thousand things, of which
(unless my esteem blinds me) his nature was incapable. All I blame him
for--or rather, all I blame and alternately like him for, was that
singularity of his temper, which would never suffer him to take pains to
set a story right with the world, however in his power. In every ill usage
of that sort, he acted precisely as in the affair of his lean horse--he
could have explained it to his honour, but his spirit was above it; and
besides, he ever looked upon the inventor, the propagator and believer of
an illiberal report alike so injurious to him--he could not stoop to tell
his story to them--and so trusted to time and truth to do it for him.
This heroic cast produced him inconveniences in many respects--in the
present it was followed by the fixed resentment of Phutatorius, who, as
Yorick had just made an end of his chesnut, rose up from his chair a second
time, to let him know it--which indeed he did with a smile; saying only--
that he would endeavour not to forget the obligation.
But you must mark and carefully separate and distinguish these two things
in your mind.
--The smile was for the company.
--The threat was for Yorick.
Chapter 2.LXIII.
--Can you tell me, quoth Phutatorius, speaking to Gastripheres who sat next
to him--for one would not apply to a surgeon in so foolish an affair--can
you tell me, Gastripheres, what is best to take out the fire?--Ask
Eugenius, said Gastripheres.--That greatly depends, said Eugenius,
pretending ignorance of the adventure, upon the nature of the part--If it
is a tender part, and a part which can conveniently be wrapt up--It is both
the one and the other, replied Phutatorius, laying his hand as he spoke,
with an emphatical nod of his head, upon the part in question, and lifting
up his right leg at the same time to ease and ventilate it.--If that is the
case, said Eugenius, I would advise you, Phutatorius, not to tamper with it
by any means; but if you will send to the next printer, and trust your cure
to such a simple thing as a soft sheet of paper just come off the press--
you need do nothing more than twist it round.--The damp paper, quoth Yorick
(who sat next to his friend Eugenius) though I know it has a refreshing
coolness in it--yet I presume is no more than the vehicle--and that the oil
and lamp-black with which the paper is so strongly impregnated, does the
business.--Right, said Eugenius, and is, of any outward application I would
venture to recommend, the most anodyne and safe.
Was it my case, said Gastripheres, as the main thing is the oil and lamp-
black, I should spread them thick upon a rag, and clap it on directly.--
That would make a very devil of it, replied Yorick.--And besides, added
Eugenius, it would not answer the intention, which is the extreme neatness
and elegance of the prescription, which the Faculty hold to be half in
half;--for consider, if the type is a very small one (which it should be)
the sanative particles, which come into contact in this form, have the
advantage of being spread so infinitely thin, and with such a mathematical
equality (fresh paragraphs and large capitals excepted) as no art or
management of the spatula can come up to.--It falls out very luckily,
replied Phutatorius, that the second edition of my treatise de Concubinis
retinendis is at this instant in the press.--You may take any leaf of it,
said Eugenius--no matter which.--Provided, quoth Yorick, there is no bawdry
in it.--
They are just now, replied Phutatorius, printing off the ninth chapter--
which is the last chapter but one in the book.--Pray what is the title of
that chapter? said Yorick; making a respectful bow to Phutatorius as he
spoke.--I think, answered Phutatorius, 'tis that de re concubinaria.
For Heaven's sake keep out of that chapter, quoth Yorick.
--By all means--added Eugenius.
Chapter 2.LXIV.
--Now, quoth Didius, rising up, and laying his right hand with his fingers
spread upon his breast--had such a blunder about a christian-name happened
before the Reformation--(It happened the day before yesterday, quoth my
uncle Toby to himself)--and when baptism was administer'd in Latin--('Twas
all in English, said my uncle)--many things might have coincided with it,
and upon the authority of sundry decreed cases, to have pronounced the
baptism null, with a power of giving the child a new name--Had a priest,
for instance, which was no uncommon thing, through ignorance of the Latin
tongue, baptized a child of Tom-o'Stiles, in nomine patriae & filia &
spiritum sanctos--the baptism was held null.--I beg your pardon, replied
Kysarcius--in that case, as the mistake was only the terminations, the
baptism was valid--and to have rendered it null, the blunder of the priest
should have fallen upon the first syllable of each noun--and not, as in
your case, upon the last.
My father delighted in subtleties of this kind, and listen'd with infinite
attention.
Gastripheres, for example, continued Kysarcius, baptizes a child of John
Stradling's in Gomine gatris, &c. &c. instead of in Nomine patris, &c.--Is
this a baptism? No--say the ablest canonists; in as much as the radix of
each word is hereby torn up, and the sense and meaning of them removed and
changed quite to another object; for Gomine does not signify a name, nor
gatris a father.--What do they signify? said my uncle Toby.--Nothing at
all--quoth Yorick.--Ergo, such a baptism is null, said Kysarcius.--
In course, answered Yorick, in a tone two parts jest and one part earnest.-
-
But in the case cited, continued Kysarcius, where patriae is put for
patris, filia for filii, and so on--as it is a fault only in the
declension, and the roots of the words continue untouch'd, the inflections
of their branches either this way or that, does not in any sort hinder the
baptism, inasmuch as the same sense continues in the words as before.--But
then, said Didius, the intention of the priest's pronouncing them
grammatically must have been proved to have gone along with it.--Right,
answered Kysarcius; and of this, brother Didius, we have an instance in a
decree of the decretals of Pope Leo the IIId.--But my brother's child,
cried my uncle Toby, has nothing to do with the Pope--'tis the plain child
of a Protestant gentleman, christen'd Tristram against the wills and wishes
both of his father and mother, and all who are a-kin to it.--
If the wills and wishes, said Kysarcius, interrupting my uncle Toby, of
those only who stand related to Mr. Shandy's child, were to have weight in
this matter, Mrs. Shandy, of all people, has the least to do in it.--My
uncle Toby lay'd down his pipe, and my father drew his chair still closer
to the table, to hear the conclusion of so strange an introduction.
--It has not only been a question, Captain Shandy, amongst the (Vide
Swinburn on Testaments, Part 7. para 8.) best lawyers and civilians in this
land, continued Kysarcius, 'Whether the mother be of kin to her child,'--
but, after much dispassionate enquiry and jactitation of the arguments on
all sides--it has been adjudged for the negative--namely, 'That the mother
is not of kin to her child.' (Vide Brook Abridg. Tit. Administr. N. 47.) 
My father instantly clapp'd his hand upon my uncle Toby's mouth, under
colour of whispering in his ear;--the truth was, he was alarmed for
Lillabullero--and having a great desire to hear more of so curious an
argument--he begg'd my uncle Toby, for heaven's sake, not to disappoint him
in it.--My uncle Toby gave a nod--resumed his pipe, and contenting himself
with whistling Lillabullero inwardly--Kysarcius, Didius, and Triptolemus
went on with the discourse as follows:
This determination, continued Kysarcius, how contrary soever it may seem to
run to the stream of vulgar ideas, yet had reason strongly on its side; and
has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous case, known
commonly by the name of the Duke of Suffolk's case.--It is cited in Brook,
said Triptolemus--And taken notice of by Lord Coke, added Didius.--And you
may find it in Swinburn on Testaments, said Kysarcius.
The case, Mr. Shandy, was this:
In the reign of Edward the Sixth, Charles duke of Suffolk having issue a
son by one venter, and a daughter by another venter, made his last will,
wherein he devised goods to his son, and died; after whose death the son
died also--but without will, without wife, and without child--his mother
and his sister by the father's side (for she was born of the former venter)
then living. The mother took the administration of her son's goods,
according to the statute of the 21st of Harry the Eighth, whereby it is
enacted, That in case any person die intestate the administration of his
goods shall be committed to the next of kin.
The administration being thus (surreptitiously) granted to the mother, the
sister by the father's side commenced a suit before the Ecclesiastical
Judge, alledging, 1st, That she herself was next of kin; and 2dly, That the
mother was not of kin at all to the party deceased; and therefore prayed
the court, that the administration granted to the mother might be revoked,
and be committed unto her, as next of kin to the deceased, by force of the
said statute.
Hereupon, as it was a great cause, and much depending upon its issue--and
many causes of great property likely to be decided in times to come, by the
precedent to be then made--the most learned, as well in the laws of this
realm, as in the civil law, were consulted together, whether the mother was
of kin to her son, or no.--Whereunto not only the temporal lawyers--but the
church lawyers--the juris-consulti--the jurisprudentes--the civilians--the
advocates--the commissaries--the judges of the consistory and prerogative
courts of Canterbury and York, with the master of the faculties, were all
unanimously of opinion, That the mother was not of (Mater non numeratur
inter consanguineos, Bald. in ult. C. de Verb. signific.) kin to her
child.--
And what said the duchess of Suffolk to it? said my uncle Toby.
The unexpectedness of my uncle Toby's question, confounded Kysarcius more
than the ablest advocate--He stopp'd a full minute, looking in my uncle
Toby's face without replying--and in that single minute Triptolemus put by
him, and took the lead as follows.
'Tis a ground and principle in the law, said Triptolemus, that things do
not ascend, but descend in it; and I make no doubt 'tis for this cause,
that however true it is, that the child may be of the blood and seed of its
parents--that the parents, nevertheless, are not of the blood and seed of
it; inasmuch as the parents are not begot by the child, but the child by
the parents--For so they write, Liberi sunt de sanguine patris & matris,
sed pater & mater non sunt de sanguine liberorum.
--But this, Triptolemus, cried Didius, proves too much--for from this
authority cited it would follow, not only what indeed is granted on all
sides, that the mother is not of kin to her child--but the father
likewise.--It is held, said Triptolemus, the better opinion; because the
father, the mother, and the child, though they be three persons, yet are
they but (una caro (Vide Brook Abridg. tit. Administr. N .47.)) one flesh;
and consequently no degree of kindred--or any method of acquiring one in
nature.--There you push the argument again too far, cried Didius--for there
is no prohibition in nature, though there is in the Levitical law--but that
a man may beget a child upon his grandmother--in which case, supposing the
issue a daughter, she would stand in relation both of--But who ever
thought, cried Kysarcius, of laying with his grandmother?--The young
gentleman, replied Yorick, whom Selden speaks of--who not only thought of
it, but justified his intention to his father by the argument drawn from
the law of retaliation.--'You laid, Sir, with my mother,' said the lad--
'why may not I lay with yours?'--'Tis the Argumentum commune, added
Yorick.--'Tis as good, replied Eugenius, taking down his hat, as they
deserve.
The company broke up.
Chapter 2.LXV.
--And pray, said my uncle Toby, leaning upon Yorick, as he and my father
were helping him leisurely down the stairs--don't be terrified, madam, this
stair-case conversation is not so long as the last--And pray, Yorick, said
my uncle Toby, which way is this said affair of Tristram at length settled
by these learned men? Very satisfactorily, replied Yorick; no mortal, Sir,
has any concern with it--for Mrs. Shandy the mother is nothing at all a-kin
to him--and as the mother's is the surest side--Mr. Shandy, in course is
still less than nothing--In short, he is not as much a-kin to him, Sir, as
I am.--
--That may well be, said my father, shaking his head.
--Let the learned say what they will, there must certainly, quoth my uncle
Toby, have been some sort of consanguinity betwixt the duchess of Suffolk
and her son.
The vulgar are of the same opinion, quoth Yorick, to this hour.
Chapter 2.LXVI.
Though my father was hugely tickled with the subtleties of these learned
discourses--'twas still but like the anointing of a broken bone--The moment
he got home, the weight of his afflictions returned upon him but so much
the heavier, as is ever the case when the staff we lean on slips from under
us.--He became pensive--walked frequently forth to the fish-pond--let down
one loop of his hat--sigh'd often--forbore to snap--and, as the hasty
sparks of temper, which occasion snapping, so much assist perspiration and
digestion, as Hippocrates tells us--he had certainly fallen ill with the
extinction of them, had not his thoughts been critically drawn off, and his
health rescued by a fresh train of disquietudes left him, with a legacy of
a thousand pounds, by my aunt Dinah.
My father had scarce read the letter, when taking the thing by the right
end, he instantly began to plague and puzzle his head how to lay it out
mostly to the honour of his family.--A hundred-and-fifty odd projects took
possession of his brains by turns--he would do this, and that and t'other--
He would go to Rome--he would go to law--he would buy stock--he would buy
John Hobson's farm--he would new fore front his house, and add a new wing
to make it even--There was a fine water-mill on this side, and he would
build a wind-mill on the other side of the river in full view to answer it-
-But above all things in the world, he would inclose the great Ox-moor, and
send out my brother Bobby immediately upon his travels.
But as the sum was finite, and consequently could not do every thing--and
in truth very few of these to any purpose--of all the projects which
offered themselves upon this occasion, the two last seemed to make the
deepest impression; and he would infallibly have determined upon both at
once, but for the small inconvenience hinted at above, which absolutely put
him under a necessity of deciding in favour either of the one or the other.
This was not altogether so easy to be done; for though 'tis certain my
father had long before set his heart upon this necessary part of my
brother's education, and like a prudent man had actually determined to
carry it into execution, with the first money that returned from the second
creation of actions in the Missisippi-scheme, in which he was an
adventurer--yet the Ox-moor, which was a fine, large, whinny, undrained,
unimproved common, belonging to the Shandy-estate, had almost as old a
claim upon him: he had long and affectionately set his heart upon turning
it likewise to some account.
But having never hitherto been pressed with such a conjuncture of things,
as made it necessary to settle either the priority or justice of their
claims--like a wise man he had refrained entering into any nice or critical
examination about them: so that upon the dismission of every other project
at this crisis--the two old projects, the Ox-moor and my Brother, divided
him again; and so equal a match were they for each other, as to become the
occasion of no small contest in the old gentleman's mind--which of the two
should be set o'going first.
--People may laugh as they will--but the case was this.
It had ever been the custom of the family, and by length of time was almost
become a matter of common right, that the eldest son of it should have free
ingress, egress, and regress into foreign parts before marriage--not only
for the sake of bettering his own private parts, by the benefit of exercise
and change of so much air--but simply for the mere delectation of his
fancy, by the feather put into his cap, of having been abroad--tantum
valet, my father would say, quantum sonat.
Now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian indulgence--to
deprive him of it, without why or wherefore--and thereby make an example of
him, as the first Shandy unwhirl'd about Europe in a post-chaise, and only
because he was a heavy lad--would be using him ten times worse than a Turk.
On the other hand, the case of the Ox-moor was full as hard.
Exclusive of the original purchase-money, which was eight hundred pounds--
it had cost the family eight hundred pounds more in a law-suit about
fifteen years before--besides the Lord knows what trouble and vexation.
It had been moreover in possession of the Shandy-family ever since the
middle of the last century; and though it lay full in view before the
house, bounded on one extremity by the water-mill, and on the other by the
projected wind-mill spoken of above--and for all these reasons seemed to
have the fairest title of any part of the estate to the care and protection
of the family--yet by an unaccountable fatality, common to men, as well as
the ground they tread on--it had all along most shamefully been overlook'd;
and to speak the truth of it, had suffered so much by it, that it would
have made any man's heart have bled (Obadiah said) who understood the value
of the land, to have rode over it, and only seen the condition it was in.
However, as neither the purchasing this tract of ground--nor indeed the
placing of it where it lay, were either of them, properly speaking, of my
father's doing--he had never thought himself any way concerned in the
affair--till the fifteen years before, when the breaking out of that cursed
law-suit mentioned above (and which had arose about its boundaries)--which
being altogether my father's own act and deed, it naturally awakened every
other argument in its favour, and upon summing them all up together, he
saw, not merely in interest, but in honour, he was bound to do something
for it--and that now or never was the time.
I think there must certainly have been a mixture of ill-luck in it, that
the reasons on both sides should happen to be so equally balanced by each
other; for though my father weigh'd them in all humours and conditions--
spent many an anxious hour in the most profound and abstracted meditation
upon what was best to be done--reading books of farming one day--books of
travels another--laying aside all passion whatever--viewing the arguments
on both sides in all their lights and circumstances--communing every day
with my uncle Toby--arguing with Yorick, and talking over the whole affair
of the Ox-moor with Obadiah--yet nothing in all that time appeared so
strongly in behalf of the one, which was not either strictly applicable to
the other, or at least so far counterbalanced by some consideration of
equal weight, as to keep the scales even.
For to be sure, with proper helps, in the hands of some people, tho' the
Ox-moor would undoubtedly have made a different appearance in the world
from what it did, or ever could do in the condition it lay--yet every
tittle of this was true, with regard to my brother Bobby--let Obadiah say
what he would.--
In point of interest--the contest, I own, at first sight, did not appear so
undecisive betwixt them; for whenever my father took pen and ink in hand,
and set about calculating the simple expence of paring and burning, and
fencing in the Ox-moor, &c. &c.--with the certain profit it would bring him
in return--the latter turned out so prodigiously in his way of working the
account, that you would have sworn the Ox-moor would have carried all
before it. For it was plain he should reap a hundred lasts of rape, at
twenty pounds a last, the very first year--besides an excellent crop of
wheat the year following--and the year after that, to speak within bounds,
a hundred--but in all likelihood, a hundred and fifty--if not two hundred
quarters of pease and beans--besides potatoes without end.--But then, to
think he was all this while breeding up my brother, like a hog to eat them-
-knocked all on the head again, and generally left the old gentleman in
such a state of suspense--that, as he often declared to my uncle Toby--he
knew no more than his heels what to do.
No body, but he who has felt it, can conceive what a plaguing thing it is
to have a man's mind torn asunder by two projects of equal strength, both
obstinately pulling in a contrary direction at the same time: for to say
nothing of the havock, which by a certain consequence is unavoidably made
by it all over the finer system of the nerves, which you know convey the
animal spirits and more subtle juices from the heart to the head, and so
on--it is not to be told in what a degree such a wayward kind of friction
works upon the more gross and solid parts, wasting the fat and impairing
the strength of a man every time as it goes backwards and forwards.
My father had certainly sunk under this evil, as certainly as he had done
under that of my Christian Name--had he not been rescued out of it, as he
was out of that, by a fresh evil--the misfortune of my brother Bobby's
death.
What is the life of man! Is it not to shift from side to side?--from
sorrow to sorrow?--to button up one cause of vexation--and unbutton
another?
Chapter 2.LXVII.
From this moment I am to be considered as heir-apparent to the Shandy
family--and it is from this point properly, that the story of my Life and
my Opinions sets out. With all my hurry and precipitation, I have but been
clearing the ground to raise the building--and such a building do I foresee
it will turn out, as never was planned, and as never was executed since
Adam. In less than five minutes I shall have thrown my pen into the fire,
and the little drop of thick ink which is left remaining at the bottom of
my ink-horn, after it--I have but half a score things to do in the time--I
have a thing to name--a thing to lament--a thing to hope--a thing to
promise, and a thing to threaten--I have a thing to suppose--a thing to
declare--a thing to conceal--a thing to choose, and a thing to pray for--
This chapter, therefore, I name the chapter of Things--and my next chapter
to it, that is, the first chapter of my next volume, if I live, shall be my
chapter upon Whiskers, in order to keep up some sort of connection in my
works.
The thing I lament is, that things have crowded in so thick upon me, that I
have not been able to get into that part of my work, towards which I have
all the way looked forwards, with so much earnest desire; and that is the
Campaigns, but especially the amours of my uncle Toby, the events of which
are of so singular a nature, and so Cervantick a cast, that if I can so
manage it, as to convey but the same impressions to every other brain,
which the occurrences themselves excite in my own--I will answer for it the
book shall make its way in the world, much better than its master has done
before it.--Oh Tristram! Tristram! can this but be once brought about--the
credit, which will attend thee as an author, shall counterbalance the many
evils will have befallen thee as a man--thou wilt feast upon the one--when
thou hast lost all sense and remembrance of the other!--
No wonder I itch so much as I do, to get at these amours--They are the
choicest morsel of my whole story! and when I do get at 'em--assure
yourselves, good folks--(nor do I value whose squeamish stomach takes
offence at it) I shall not be at all nice in the choice of my words!--and
that's the thing I have to declare.--I shall never get all through in five
minutes, that I fear--and the thing I hope is, that your worships and
reverences are not offended--if you are, depend upon't I'll give you
something, my good gentry, next year to be offended at--that's my dear
Jenny's way--but who my Jenny is--and which is the right and which the
wrong end of a woman, is the thing to be concealed--it shall be told you in
the next chapter but one to my chapter of Button-holes--and not one chapter
before.
And now that you have just got to the end of these (According to the
preceding Editions.) three volumes--the thing I have to ask is, how you
feel your heads? my own akes dismally!--as for your healths, I know, they
are much better.--True Shandeism, think what you will against it, opens the
heart and lungs, and like all those affections which partake of its nature,
it forces the blood and other vital fluids of the body to run freely
through its channels, makes the wheel of life run long and cheerfully
round.
Was I left, like Sancho Panca, to choose my kingdom, it should not be
maritime--or a kingdom of blacks to make a penny of;--no, it should be a
kingdom of hearty laughing subjects: And as the bilious and more saturnine
passions, by creating disorders in the blood and humours, have as bad an
influence, I see, upon the body politick as body natural--and as nothing
but a habit of virtue can fully govern those passions, and subject them to
reason--I should add to my prayer--that God would give my subjects grace to
be as Wise as they were Merry; and then should I be the happiest monarch,
and they are the happiest people under heaven.
And so with this moral for the present, may it please your worships and
your reverences, I take my leave of you till this time twelve-month, when,
(unless this vile cough kills me in the mean time) I'll have another pluck
at your beards, and lay open a story to the world you little dream of.

My Lord,
I Humbly beg leave to offer you these two Volumes (Volumes V. and VI. in

I have, could produce:--had Providence granted me a larger stock of either,
they had been a much more proper present to your Lordship.
I beg your Lordship will forgive me, if, at the same time I dedicate this

The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gent.
Chapter 3.I.
If it had not been for those two mettlesome tits, and that madcap of a
postillion who drove them from Stilton to Stamford, the thought had never
entered my head. He flew like lightning--there was a slope of three miles
and a half--we scarce touched the ground--the motion was most rapid--most
impetuous--'twas communicated to my brain--my heart partook of it--'By the
great God of day,' said I, looking towards the sun, and thrusting my arm
out of the fore-window of the chaise, as I made my vow, 'I will lock up my
study-door the moment I get home, and throw the key of it ninety feet below
the surface of the earth, into the draw-well at the back of my house.'
The London waggon confirmed me in my resolution; it hung tottering upon the
hill, scarce progressive, drag'd--drag'd up by eight heavy beasts--'by main
strength!--quoth I, nodding--but your betters draw the same way--and
something of every body's!--O rare!'
Tell me, ye learned, shall we for ever be adding so much to the bulk--so
little to the stock?
Shall we for ever make new books, as apothecaries make new mixtures, by
pouring only out of one vessel into another?
Are we for ever to be twisting, and untwisting the same rope? for ever in
the same track--for ever at the same pace?
Shall we be destined to the days of eternity, on holy-days, as well as
working-days, to be shewing the relicks of learning, as monks do the
relicks of their saints--without working one--one single miracle with them?
Who made Man, with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in a moment--
that great, that most excellent, and most noble creature of the world--the
miracle of nature, as Zoroaster in his book (Greek) called him--the
Shekinah of the divine presence, as Chrysostom--the image of God, as Moses-
-the ray of divinity, as Plato--the marvel of marvels, as Aristotle--to go
sneaking on at this pitiful--pimping--pettifogging rate?
I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the occasion--but if there is no
catachresis in the wish, and no sin in it, I wish from my soul, that every
imitator in Great Britain, France, and Ireland, had the farcy for his
pains; and that there was a good farcical house, large enough to hold--aye-
-and sublimate them, shag rag and bob-tail, male and female, all together: 
and this leads me to the affair of Whiskers--but, by what chain of ideas--I
leave as a legacy in mort-main to Prudes and Tartufs, to enjoy and make the
most of.
Upon Whiskers.
I'm sorry I made it--'twas as inconsiderate a promise as ever entered a
man's head--A chapter upon whiskers! alas! the world will not bear it--'tis
a delicate world--but I knew not of what mettle it was made--nor had I ever
seen the under-written fragment; otherwise, as surely as noses are noses,
and whiskers are whiskers still (let the world say what it will to the
contrary); so surely would I have steered clear of this dangerous chapter.
The Fragment.
. . .--You are half asleep, my good lady, said the old gentleman, taking
hold of the old lady's hand, and giving it a gentle squeeze, as he
pronounced the word Whiskers--shall we change the subject? By no means,
replied the old lady--I like your account of those matters; so throwing a
thin gauze handkerchief over her head, and leaning it back upon the chair
with her face turned towards him, and advancing her two feet as she
reclined herself--I desire, continued she, you will go on.
The old gentleman went on as follows:--Whiskers! cried the queen of
Navarre, dropping her knotting ball, as La Fosseuse uttered the word--
Whiskers, madam, said La Fosseuse, pinning the ball to the queen's apron,
and making a courtesy as she repeated it.
La Fosseuse's voice was naturally soft and low, yet 'twas an articulate
voice: and every letter of the word Whiskers fell distinctly upon the
queen of Navarre's ear--Whiskers! cried the queen, laying a greater stress
upon the word, and as if she had still distrusted her ears--Whiskers!
replied La Fosseuse, repeating the word a third time--There is not a
cavalier, madam, of his age in Navarre, continued the maid of honour,
pressing the page's interest upon the queen, that has so gallant a pair--Of
what? cried Margaret, smiling--Of whiskers, said La Fosseuse, with infinite
modesty.
The word Whiskers still stood its ground, and continued to be made use of
in most of the best companies throughout the little kingdom of Navarre,
notwithstanding the indiscreet use which La Fosseuse had made of it: the
truth was, La Fosseuse had pronounced the word, not only before the queen,
but upon sundry other occasions at court, with an accent which always
implied something of a mystery--And as the court of Margaret, as all the
world knows, was at that time a mixture of gallantry and devotion--and
whiskers being as applicable to the one, as the other, the word naturally
stood its ground--it gained full as much as it lost; that is, the clergy
were for it--the laity were against it--and for the women,--they were
divided.
The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur De Croix, was at
that time beginning to draw the attention of the maids of honour towards
the terrace before the palace gate, where the guard was mounted. The lady
De Baussiere fell deeply in love with him,--La Battarelle did the same--it
was the finest weather for it, that ever was remembered in Navarre--La
Guyol, La Maronette, La Sabatiere, fell in love with the Sieur De Croix
also--La Rebours and La Fosseuse knew better--De Croix had failed in an
attempt to recommend himself to La Rebours; and La Rebours and La Fosseuse
were inseparable.
The queen of Navarre was sitting with her ladies in the painted bow-window,
facing the gate of the second court, as De Croix passed through it--He is
handsome, said the Lady Baussiere--He has a good mien, said La Battarelle--
He is finely shaped, said La Guyol--I never saw an officer of the horse-
guards in my life, said La Maronette, with two such legs--Or who stood so
well upon them, said La Sabatiere--But he has no whiskers, cried La
Fosseuse--Not a pile, said La Rebours.
The queen went directly to her oratory, musing all the way, as she walked
through the gallery, upon the subject; turning it this way and that way in
her fancy--Ave Maria!--what can La-Fosseuse mean? said she, kneeling down
upon the cushion.
La Guyol, La Battarelle, La Maronette, La Sabatiere, retired instantly to
their chambers--Whiskers! said all four of them to themselves, as they
bolted their doors on the inside.
The Lady Carnavallette was counting her beads with both hands, unsuspected,
under her farthingal--from St. Antony down to St. Ursula inclusive, not a
saint passed through her fingers without whiskers; St. Francis, St.
Dominick, St. Bennet, St. Basil, St. Bridget, had all whiskers.
The Lady Baussiere had got into a wilderness of conceits, with moralizing
too intricately upon La Fosseuse's text--She mounted her palfrey, her page
followed her--the host passed by--the Lady Baussiere rode on.
One denier, cried the order of mercy--one single denier, in behalf of a
thousand patient captives, whose eyes look towards heaven and you for their
redemption.
--The Lady Baussiere rode on.
Pity the unhappy, said a devout, venerable, hoary-headed man, meekly
holding up a box, begirt with iron, in his withered hands--I beg for the
unfortunate--good my Lady, 'tis for a prison--for an hospital--'tis for an
old man--a poor man undone by shipwreck, by suretyship, by fire--I call God
and all his angels to witness--'tis to clothe the naked--to feed the
hungry--'tis to comfort the sick and the broken-hearted.
The Lady Baussiere rode on.
A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground.
--The Lady Baussiere rode on.
He ran begging bare-headed on one side of her palfrey, conjuring her by the
former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity, &c.--Cousin, aunt,
sister, mother,--for virtue's sake, for your own, for mine, for Christ's
sake, remember me--pity me.
--The Lady Baussiere rode on.
Take hold of my whiskers, said the Lady Baussiere--The page took hold of
her palfrey. She dismounted at the end of the terrace.
There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of themselves
about our eyes and eye-brows; and there is a consciousness of it, somewhere
about the heart, which serves but to make these etchings the stronger--we
see, spell, and put them together without a dictionary.
Ha, ha! he, hee! cried La Guyol and La Sabatiere, looking close at each
other's prints--Ho, ho! cried La Battarelle and Maronette, doing the same:-
-Whist! cried one--ft, ft,--said a second--hush, quoth a third--poo, poo,
replied a fourth--gramercy! cried the Lady Carnavallette;--'twas she who
bewhisker'd St. Bridget.
La Fosseuse drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair, and having traced
the outline of a small whisker, with the blunt end of it, upon one side of
her upper lip, put in into La Rebours' hand--La Rebours shook her head.
The Lady Baussiere coughed thrice into the inside of her muff--La Guyol
smiled--Fy, said the Lady Baussiere. The queen of Navarre touched her eye
with the tip of her fore-finger--as much as to say, I understand you all.
'Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined: La Fosseuse had given
it a wound, and it was not the better for passing through all these
defiles--It made a faint stand, however, for a few months, by the
expiration of which, the Sieur De Croix, finding it high time to leave
Navarre for want of whiskers--the word in course became indecent, and
(after a few efforts) absolutely unfit for use.
The best word, in the best language of the best world, must have suffered
under such combinations.--The curate of d'Estella wrote a book against
them, setting forth the dangers of accessory ideas, and warning the
Navarois against them.
Does not all the world know, said the curate d'Estella at the conclusion of
his work, that Noses ran the same fate some centuries ago in most parts of
Europe, which Whiskers have now done in the kingdom of Navarre?--The evil
indeed spread no farther then--but have not beds and bolsters, and night-
caps and chamber-pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since? Are
not trouse, and placket-holes, and pump-handles--and spigots and faucets,
in danger still from the same association?--Chastity, by nature, the
gentlest of all affections--give it but its head--'tis like a ramping and a
roaring lion.
The drift of the curate d'Estella's argument was not understood.--They ran
the scent the wrong way.--The world bridled his ass at the tail.--And when
the extremes of Delicacy, and the beginnings of Concupiscence, hold their
next provincial chapter together, they may decree that bawdy also.
Chapter 3.II.
When my father received the letter which brought him the melancholy account
of my brother Bobby's death, he was busy calculating the expence of his
riding post from Calais to Paris, and so on to Lyons.
'Twas a most inauspicious journey; my father having had every foot of it to
travel over again, and his calculation to begin afresh, when he had almost
got to the end of it, by Obadiah's opening the door to acquaint him the
family was out of yeast--and to ask whether he might not take the great
coach-horse early in the morning and ride in search of some.--With all my
heart, Obadiah, said my father (pursuing his journey)--take the coach-
horse, and welcome.--But he wants a shoe, poor creature! said Obadiah.--
Poor creature! said my uncle Toby, vibrating the note back again, like a
string in unison. Then ride the Scotch horse, quoth my father hastily.--He
cannot bear a saddle upon his back, quoth Obadiah, for the whole world.--
The devil's in that horse; then take Patriot, cried my father, and shut the
door.--Patriot is sold, said Obadiah. Here's for you! cried my father,
making a pause, and looking in my uncle Toby's face, as if the thing had
not been a matter of fact.--Your worship ordered me to sell him last April,
said Obadiah.--Then go on foot for your pains, cried my father--I had much
rather walk than ride, said Obadiah, shutting the door.
What plagues, cried my father, going on with his calculation.--But the
waters are out, said Obadiah,--opening the door again.
Till that moment, my father, who had a map of Sanson's, and a book of the
post-roads before him, had kept his hand upon the head of his compasses,
with one foot of them fixed upon Nevers, the last stage he had paid for--
purposing to go on from that point with his journey and calculation, as
soon as Obadiah quitted the room: but this second attack of Obadiah's, in
opening the door and laying the whole country under water, was too much.--
He let go his compasses--or rather with a mixed motion between accident and
anger, he threw them upon the table; and then there was nothing for him to
do, but to return back to Calais (like many others) as wise as he had set
out.
When the letter was brought into the parlour, which contained the news of
my brother's death, my father had got forwards again upon his journey to
within a stride of the compasses of the very same stage of Nevers.--By your
leave, Mons. Sanson, cried my father, striking the point of his compasses
through Nevers into the table--and nodding to my uncle Toby to see what was
in the letter--twice of one night, is too much for an English gentleman and
his son, Mons. Sanson, to be turned back from so lousy a town as Nevers--
What think'st thou, Toby? added my father in a sprightly tone.--Unless it
be a garrison town, said my uncle Toby--for then--I shall be a fool, said
my father, smiling to himself, as long as I live.--So giving a second nod--
and keeping his compasses still upon Nevers with one hand, and holding his
book of the post-roads in the other--half calculating and half listening,
he leaned forwards upon the table with both elbows, as my uncle Toby hummed
over the letter.
. . .he's gone! said my uncle Toby--Where--Who? cried my father.--My
nephew, said my uncle Toby.--What--without leave--without money--without
governor? cried my father in amazement. No:--he is dead, my dear brother,
quoth my uncle Toby.--Without being ill? cried my father again.--I dare say
not, said my uncle Toby, in a low voice, and fetching a deep sigh from the
bottom of his heart, he has been ill enough, poor lad! I'll answer for
him--for he is dead.
When Agrippina was told of her son's death, Tacitus informs us, that, not
being able to moderate the violence of her passions, she abruptly broke off
her work--My father stuck his compasses into Nevers, but so much the
faster.--What contrarieties! his, indeed, was matter of calculation!--
Agrippina's must have been quite a different affair; who else could pretend
to reason from history?
How my father went on, in my opinion, deserves a chapter to itself.--
Chapter 3.III.
. . .--And a chapter it shall have, and a devil of a one too--so look to
yourselves.
'Tis either Plato, or Plutarch, or Seneca, or Xenophon, or Epictetus, or
Theophrastus, or Lucian--or some one perhaps of later date--either Cardan,
or Budaeus, or Petrarch, or Stella--or possibly it may be some divine or
father of the church, St. Austin, or St. Cyprian, or Barnard, who affirms
that it is an irresistible and natural passion to weep for the loss of our
friends or children--and Seneca (I'm positive) tells us somewhere, that
such griefs evacuate themselves best by that particular channel--And
accordingly we find, that David wept for his son Absalom--Adrian for his
Antinous--Niobe for her children, and that Apollodorus and Crito both shed
tears for Socrates before his death.
My father managed his affliction otherwise; and indeed differently from
most men either ancient or modern; for he neither wept it away, as the
Hebrews and the Romans--or slept it off, as the Laplanders--or hanged it,
as the English, or drowned it, as the Germans,--nor did he curse it, or
damn it, or excommunicate it, or rhyme it, or lillabullero it.--
--He got rid of it, however.
Will your worships give me leave to squeeze in a story between these two
pages?
When Tully was bereft of his dear daughter Tullia, at first he laid it to
his heart,--he listened to the voice of nature, and modulated his own unto
it.--O my Tullia! my daughter! my child!--still, still, still,--'twas O my
Tullia!--my Tullia! Methinks I see my Tullia, I hear my Tullia, I talk
with my Tullia.--But as soon as he began to look into the stores of
philosophy, and consider how many excellent things might be said upon the
occasion--no body upon earth can conceive, says the great orator, how
happy, how joyful it made me.
My father was as proud of his eloquence as Marcus Tullius Cicero could be
for his life, and, for aught I am convinced of to the contrary at present,
with as much reason: it was indeed his strength--and his weakness too.--
His strength--for he was by nature eloquent; and his weakness--for he was
hourly a dupe to it; and, provided an occasion in life would but permit him
to shew his talents, or say either a wise thing, a witty, or a shrewd one--
(bating the case of a systematic misfortune)--he had all he wanted.--A
blessing which tied up my father's tongue, and a misfortune which let it
loose with a good grace, were pretty equal: sometimes, indeed, the
misfortune was the better of the two; for instance, where the pleasure of
the harangue was as ten, and the pain of the misfortune but as five--my
father gained half in half, and consequently was as well again off, as if
it had never befallen him.
This clue will unravel what otherwise would seem very inconsistent in my
father's domestic character; and it is this, that, in the provocations
arising from the neglects and blunders of servants, or other mishaps
unavoidable in a family, his anger, or rather the duration of it, eternally
ran counter to all conjecture.
My father had a favourite little mare, which he had consigned over to a
most beautiful Arabian horse, in order to have a pad out of her for his own
riding: he was sanguine in all his projects; so talked about his pad every
day with as absolute a security, as if it had been reared, broke,--and
bridled and saddled at his door ready for mounting. By some neglect or
other in Obadiah, it so fell out, that my father's expectations were
answered with nothing better than a mule, and as ugly a beast of the kind
as ever was produced.
My mother and my uncle Toby expected my father would be the death of
Obadiah--and that there never would be an end of the disaster--See here!
you rascal, cried my father, pointing to the mule, what you have done!--It
was not me, said Obadiah.--How do I know that? replied my father.
Triumph swam in my father's eyes, at the repartee--the Attic salt brought
water into them--and so Obadiah heard no more about it.
Now let us go back to my brother's death.
Philosophy has a fine saying for every thing.--For Death it has an entire
set; the misery was, they all at once rushed into my father's head, that
'twas difficult to string them together, so as to make any thing of a
consistent show out of them.--He took them as they came.
''Tis an inevitable chance--the first statute in Magna Charta--it is an
everlasting act of parliament, my dear brother,--All must die.
'If my son could not have died, it had been matter of wonder,--not that he
is dead.
'Monarchs and princes dance in the same ring with us.
'--To die, is the great debt and tribute due unto nature: tombs and
monuments, which should perpetuate our memories, pay it themselves; and the
proudest pyramid of them all, which wealth and science have erected, has
lost its apex, and stands obtruncated in the traveller's horizon.' (My
father found he got great ease, and went on)--'Kingdoms and provinces, and
towns and cities, have they not their periods? and when those principles
and powers, which at first cemented and put them together, have performed
their several evolutions, they fall back.'--Brother Shandy, said my uncle
Toby, laying down his pipe at the word evolutions--Revolutions, I meant,
quoth my father,--by heaven! I meant revolutions, brother Toby--evolutions
is nonsense.--'Tis not nonsense--said my uncle Toby.--But is it not
nonsense to break the thread of such a discourse upon such an occasion?
cried my father--do not--dear Toby, continued he, taking him by the hand,
do not--do not, I beseech thee, interrupt me at this crisis.--My uncle Toby
put his pipe into his mouth.
'Where is Troy and Mycenae, and Thebes and Delos, and Persepolis and
Agrigentum?'--continued my father, taking up his book of post-roads, which
he had laid down.--'What is become, brother Toby, of Nineveh and Babylon,
of Cizicum and Mitylenae? The fairest towns that ever the sun rose upon,
are now no more; the names only are left, and those (for many of them are
wrong spelt) are falling themselves by piece-meals to decay, and in length
of time will be forgotten, and involved with every thing in a perpetual
night: the world itself, brother Toby, must--must come to an end.
'Returning out of Asia, when I sailed from Aegina towards Megara,' (when
can this have been? thought my uncle Toby,) ' I began to view the country
round about. Aegina was behind me, Megara was before, Pyraeus on the right
hand, Corinth on the left.--What flourishing towns now prostrate upon the
earth! Alas! alas! said I to myself, that man should disturb his soul for
the loss of a child, when so much as this lies awfully buried in his
presence--Remember, said I to myself again--remember thou art a man.'--
Now my uncle Toby knew not that this last paragraph was an extract of
Servius Sulpicius's consolatory letter to Tully.--He had as little skill,
honest man, in the fragments, as he had in the whole pieces of antiquity.--
And as my father, whilst he was concerned in the Turkey trade, had been
three or four different times in the Levant, in one of which he had stayed
a whole year and an half at Zant, my uncle Toby naturally concluded, that,
in some one of these periods, he had taken a trip across the Archipelago
into Asia; and that all this sailing affair with Aegina behind, and Megara
before, and Pyraeus on the right hand, &c. &c. was nothing more than the
true course of my father's voyage and reflections.--'Twas certainly in his
manner, and many an undertaking critic would have built two stories higher
upon worse foundations.--And pray, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, laying the
end of his pipe upon my father's hand in a kindly way of interruption--but
waiting till he finished the account--what year of our Lord was this?--
'Twas no year of our Lord, replied my father.--That's impossible, cried my
uncle Toby.--Simpleton! said my father,--'twas forty years before Christ
was born.
My uncle Toby had but two things for it; either to suppose his brother to
be the wandering Jew, or that his misfortunes had disordered his brain.--
'May the Lord God of heaven and earth protect him and restore him!' said my
uncle Toby, praying silently for my father, and with tears in his eyes.
--My father placed the tears to a proper account, and went on with his
harangue with great spirit.
'There is not such great odds, brother Toby, betwixt good and evil, as the
world imagines'--(this way of setting off, by the bye, was not likely to
cure my uncle Toby's suspicions).--'Labour, sorrow, grief, sickness, want,
and woe, are the sauces of life.'--Much good may do them--said my uncle
Toby to himself.--
'My son is dead!--so much the better;--'tis a shame in such a tempest to
have but one anchor.
'But he is gone for ever from us!--be it so. He is got from under the
hands of his barber before he was bald--he is but risen from a feast before
he was surfeited--from a banquet before he had got drunken.
'The Thracians wept when a child was born,'--(and we were very near it,
quoth my uncle Toby,)--'and feasted and made merry when a man went out of
the world; and with reason.--Death opens the gate of fame, and shuts the
gate of envy after it,--it unlooses the chain of the captive, and puts the
bondsman's task into another man's hands.
'Shew me the man, who knows what life is, who dreads it, and I'll shew thee
a prisoner who dreads his liberty.'
Is it not better, my dear brother Toby, (for mark--our appetites are but
diseases,)--is it not better not to hunger at all, than to eat?--not to
thirst, than to take physic to cure it?
Is it not better to be freed from cares and agues, from love and
melancholy, and the other hot and cold fits of life, than, like a galled
traveller, who comes weary to his inn, to be bound to begin his journey
afresh?
There is no terrour, brother Toby, in its looks, but what it borrows from
groans and convulsions--and the blowing of noses and the wiping away of
tears with the bottoms of curtains, in a dying man's room.--Strip it of
these, what is it?--'Tis better in battle than in bed, said my uncle Toby.-
-Take away its hearses, its mutes, and its mourning,--its plumes,
scutcheons, and other mechanic aids--What is it?--Better in battle!
continued my father, smiling, for he had absolutely forgot my brother
Bobby--'tis terrible no way--for consider, brother Toby,--when we are--
death is not;--and when death is--we are not. My uncle Toby laid down his
pipe to consider the proposition; my father's eloquence was too rapid to
stay for any man--away it went,--and hurried my uncle Toby's ideas along
with it.--
For this reason, continued my father, 'tis worthy to recollect, how little
alteration, in great men, the approaches of death have made.--Vespasian
died in a jest upon his close-stool--Galba with a sentence--Septimus
Severus in a dispatch--Tiberius in dissimulation, and Caesar Augustus in a
compliment.--I hope 'twas a sincere one--quoth my uncle Toby.
--'Twas to his wife,--said my father.
Chapter 3.IV.
--And lastly--for all the choice anecdotes which history can produce of
this matter, continued my father,--this, like the gilded dome which covers
in the fabric--crowns all.--
'Tis of Cornelius Gallus, the praetor--which, I dare say, brother Toby, you
have read.--I dare say I have not, replied my uncle.--He died, said my
father as. . .--And if it was with his wife, said my uncle Toby--there
could be no hurt in it.-- That's more than I know--replied my father.
Chapter 3.V.
My mother was going very gingerly in the dark along the passage which led
to the parlour, as my uncle Toby pronounced the word wife.--'Tis a shrill
penetrating sound of itself, and Obadiah had helped it by leaving the door
a little a-jar, so that my mother heard enough of it to imagine herself the
subject of the conversation; so laying the edge of her finger across her
two lips--holding in her breath, and bending her head a little downwards,
with a twist of her neck--(not towards the door, but from it, by which
means her ear was brought to the chink)--she listened with all her powers:-
-the listening slave, with the Goddess of Silence at his back, could not
have given a finer thought for an intaglio.
In this attitude I am determined to let her stand for five minutes: till I
bring up the affairs of the kitchen (as Rapin does those of the church) to
the same period.
Chapter 3.VI.
Though in one sense, our family was certainly a simple machine, as it
consisted of a few wheels; yet there was thus much to be said for it, that
these wheels were set in motion by so many different springs, and acted one
upon the other from such a variety of strange principles and impulses--that
though it was a simple machine, it had all the honour and advantages of a
complex one,--and a number of as odd movements within it, as ever were
beheld in the inside of a Dutch silk-mill.
Amongst these there was one, I am going to speak of, in which, perhaps, it
was not altogether so singular, as in many others; and it was this, that
whatever motion, debate, harangue, dialogue, project, or dissertation, was
going forwards in the parlour, there was generally another at the same
time, and upon the same subject, running parallel along with it in the
kitchen.
Now to bring this about, whenever an extraordinary message, or letter, was
delivered in the parlour--or a discourse suspended till a servant went out-
-or the lines of discontent were observed to hang upon the brows of my
father or mother--or, in short, when any thing was supposed to be upon the
tapis worth knowing or listening to, 'twas the rule to leave the door, not
absolutely shut, but somewhat a-jar--as it stands just now,--which, under
covert of the bad hinge, (and that possibly might be one of the many
reasons why it was never mended,) it was not difficult to manage; by which
means, in all these cases, a passage was generally left, not indeed as wide
as the Dardanelles, but wide enough, for all that, to carry on as much of
this windward trade, as was sufficient to save my father the trouble of
governing his house;--my mother at this moment stands profiting by it.--
Obadiah did the same thing, as soon as he had left the letter upon the
table which brought the news of my brother's death, so that before my
father had well got over his surprise, and entered upon his harangue,--had
Trim got upon his legs, to speak his sentiments upon the subject.
A curious observer of nature, had he been worth the inventory of all Job's
stock--though by the bye, your curious observers are seldom worth a groat--
would have given the half of it, to have heard Corporal Trim and my father,
two orators so contrasted by nature and education, haranguing over the same
bier.
My father--a man of deep reading--prompt memory--with Cato, and Seneca, and
Epictetus, at his fingers ends.--
The corporal--with nothing--to remember--of no deeper reading than his
muster-roll--or greater names at his fingers end, than the contents of it.
The one proceeding from period to period, by metaphor and allusion, and
striking the fancy as he went along (as men of wit and fancy do) with the
entertainment and pleasantry of his pictures and images.
The other, without wit or antithesis, or point, or turn, this way or that;
but leaving the images on one side, and the picture on the other, going
straight forwards as nature could lead him, to the heart. O Trim! would to
heaven thou had'st a better historian!--would!--thy historian had a better
pair of breeches!--O ye critics! will nothing melt you?
Chapter 3.VII.
--My young master in London is dead? said Obadiah.--
--A green sattin night-gown of my mother's, which had been twice scoured,
was the first idea which Obadiah's exclamation brought into Susannah's
head.--Well might Locke write a chapter upon the imperfections of words.--
Then, quoth Susannah, we must all go into mourning.--But note a second
time: the word mourning, notwithstanding Susannah made use of it herself--
failed also of doing its office; it excited not one single idea, tinged
either with grey or black,--all was green.--The green sattin night-gown
hung there still.
--O! 'twill be the death of my poor mistress, cried Susannah.--My mother's
whole wardrobe followed.--What a procession! her red damask,--her orange
tawney,--her white and yellow lutestrings,--her brown taffata,--her bone-
laced caps, her bed-gowns, and comfortable under-petticoats.--Not a rag was
left behind.--'No,--she will never look up again,' said Susannah.
We had a fat, foolish scullion--my father, I think, kept her for her
simplicity;--she had been all autumn struggling with a dropsy.--He is dead,
said Obadiah,--he is certainly dead!--So am not I, said the foolish
scullion.
--Here is sad news, Trim, cried Susannah, wiping her eyes as Trim stepp'd
into the kitchen,--master Bobby is dead and buried--the funeral was an
interpolation of Susannah's--we shall have all to go into mourning, said
Susannah.
I hope not, said Trim.--You hope not! cried Susannah earnestly.--The
mourning ran not in Trim's head, whatever it did in Susannah's.--I hope--
said Trim, explaining himself, I hope in God the news is not true. I heard
the letter read with my own ears, answered Obadiah; and we shall have a
terrible piece of work of it in stubbing the ox-moor.--Oh! he's dead, said
Susannah.--As sure, said the scullion, as I'm alive.
I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said Trim, fetching a sigh.--
Poor creature!--poor boy!--poor gentleman!
--He was alive last Whitsontide! said the coachman.--Whitsontide! alas!
cried Trim, extending his right arm, and falling instantly into the same
attitude in which he read the sermon,--what is Whitsontide, Jonathan (for
that was the coachman's name), or Shrovetide, or any tide or time past, to
this? Are we not here now, continued the corporal (striking the end of his
stick perpendicularly upon the floor, so as to give an idea of health and
stability)--and are we not--(dropping his hat upon the ground) gone! in a
moment!--'Twas infinitely striking! Susannah burst into a flood of tears.-
-We are not stocks and stones.--Jonathan, Obadiah, the cook-maid, all
melted.--The foolish fat scullion herself, who was scouring a fish-kettle
upon her knees, was rous'd with it.--The whole kitchen crowded about the
corporal.
Now, as I perceive plainly, that the preservation of our constitution in
church and state,--and possibly the preservation of the whole world--or
what is the same thing, the distribution and balance of its property and
power, may in time to come depend greatly upon the right understanding of
this stroke of the corporal's eloquence--I do demand your attention--your
worships and reverences, for any ten pages together, take them where you
will in any other part of the work, shall sleep for it at your ease.
I said, 'we were not stocks and stones'--'tis very well. I should have
added, nor are we angels, I wish we were,--but men clothed with bodies, and
governed by our imaginations;--and what a junketing piece of work of it
there is, betwixt these and our seven senses, especially some of them, for
my own part, I own it, I am ashamed to confess. Let it suffice to affirm,
that of all the senses, the eye (for I absolutely deny the touch, though
most of your Barbati, I know, are for it) has the quickest commerce with
the soul,--gives a smarter stroke, and leaves something more inexpressible
upon the fancy, than words can either convey--or sometimes get rid of.
--I've gone a little about--no matter, 'tis for health--let us only carry
it back in our mind to the mortality of Trim's hat--'Are we not here now,--
and gone in a moment?'--There was nothing in the sentence--'twas one of
your self-evident truths we have the advantage of hearing every day; and if
Trim had not trusted more to his hat than his head--he made nothing at all
of it.
--'Are we not here now;' continued the corporal, 'and are we not'--
(dropping his hat plumb upon the ground--and pausing, before he pronounced
the word)--'gone! in a moment?' The descent of the hat was as if a heavy
lump of clay had been kneaded into the crown of it.--Nothing could have
expressed the sentiment of mortality, of which it was the type and fore-
runner, like it,--his hand seemed to vanish from under it,--it fell dead,--
the corporal's eye fixed upon it, as upon a corpse,--and Susannah burst
into a flood of tears.
Now--Ten thousand, and ten thousand times ten thousand (for matter and
motion are infinite) are the ways by which a hat may be dropped upon the
ground, without any effect.--Had he flung it, or thrown it, or cast it, or
skimmed it, or squirted it, or let it slip or fall in any possible
direction under heaven,--or in the best direction that could be given to
it,--had he dropped it like a goose--like a puppy--like an ass--or in doing
it, or even after he had done, had he looked like a fool--like a ninny--
like a nincompoop--it had fail'd, and the effect upon the heart had been
lost.
Ye who govern this mighty world and its mighty concerns with the engines of
eloquence,--who heat it, and cool it, and melt it, and mollify it,--and
then harden it again to your purpose--
Ye who wind and turn the passions with this great windlass, and, having
done it, lead the owners of them, whither ye think meet.
Ye, lastly, who drive--and why not, Ye also who are driven, like turkeys to
market with a stick and a red clout--meditate--meditate, I beseech you,
upon Trim's hat.
Chapter 3.VIII.
Stay--I have a small account to settle with the reader before Trim can go
on with his harangue.--It shall be done in two minutes.
Amongst many other book-debts, all of which I shall discharge in due time,-
-I own myself a debtor to the world for two items,--a chapter upon chamber-
maids and button-holes, which, in the former part of my work, I promised
and fully intended to pay off this year: but some of your worships and
reverences telling me, that the two subjects, especially so connected
together, might endanger the morals of the world,--I pray the chapter upon
chamber-maids and button-holes may be forgiven me,--and that they will
accept of the last chapter in lieu of it; which is nothing, an't please
your reverences, but a chapter of chamber-maids, green gowns, and old hats.
Trim took his hat off the ground,--put it upon his head,--and then went on
with his oration upon death, in manner and form following.
Chapter 3.IX.
--To us, Jonathan, who know not what want or care is--who live here in the
service of two of the best of masters--(bating in my own case his majesty
King William the Third, whom I had the honour to serve both in Ireland and
Flanders)--I own it, that from Whitsontide to within three weeks of
Christmas,--'tis not long--'tis like nothing;--but to those, Jonathan, who
know what death is, and what havock and destruction he can make, before a
man can well wheel about--'tis like a whole age.--O Jonathan! 'twould make
a good-natured man's heart bleed, to consider, continued the corporal
(standing perpendicularly), how low many a brave and upright fellow has
been laid since that time!--And trust me, Susy, added the corporal, turning
to Susannah, whose eyes were swimming in water,--before that time comes
round again,--many a bright eye will be dim.--Susannah placed it to the
right side of the page--she wept--but she court'sied too.--Are we not,
continued Trim, looking still at Susannah--are we not like a flower of the
field--a tear of pride stole in betwixt every two tears of humiliation--
else no tongue could have described Susannah's affliction--is not all flesh
grass?--Tis clay,--'tis dirt.--They all looked directly at the scullion,--
the scullion had just been scouring a fish-kettle.--It was not fair.--
--What is the finest face that ever man looked at!--I could hear Trim talk
so for ever, cried Susannah,--what is it! (Susannah laid her hand upon
Trim's shoulder)--but corruption?--Susannah took it off.
Now I love you for this--and 'tis this delicious mixture within you which
makes you dear creatures what you are--and he who hates you for it--all I
can say of the matter is--That he has either a pumpkin for his head--or a
pippin for his heart,--and whenever he is dissected 'twill be found so.
Chapter 3.X.
Whether Susannah, by taking her hand too suddenly from off the corporal's
shoulder (by the whisking about of her passions)--broke a little the chain
of his reflexions--
Or whether the corporal began to be suspicious, he had got into the
doctor's quarters, and was talking more like the chaplain than himself--
Or whether. . .Or whether--for in all such cases a man of invention and
parts may with pleasure fill a couple of pages with suppositions--which of
all these was the cause, let the curious physiologist, or the curious any
body determine--'tis certain, at least, the corporal went on thus with his
harangue.
For my own part, I declare it, that out of doors, I value not death at
all:--not this. . .added the corporal, snapping his fingers,--but with an
air which no one but the corporal could have given to the sentiment.--In
battle, I value death not this. . .and let him not take me cowardly, like
poor Joe Gibbins, in scouring his gun.--What is he? A pull of a trigger--a
push of a bayonet an inch this way or that--makes the difference.--Look
along the line--to the right--see! Jack's down! well,--'tis worth a
regiment of horse to him.--No--'tis Dick. Then Jack's no worse.--Never
mind which,--we pass on,--in hot pursuit the wound itself which brings him
is not felt,--the best way is to stand up to him,--the man who flies, is in
ten times more danger than the man who marches up into his jaws.--I've
look'd him, added the corporal, an hundred times in the face,--and know
what he is.--He's nothing, Obadiah, at all in the field.--But he's very
frightful in a house, quoth Obadiah.--I never mind it myself, said
Jonathan, upon a coach-box.--It must, in my opinion, be most natural in
bed, replied Susannah.--And could I escape him by creeping into the worst
calf's skin that ever was made into a knapsack, I would do it there--said
Trim--but that is nature.
--Nature is nature, said Jonathan.--And that is the reason, cried Susannah,
I so much pity my mistress.--She will never get the better of it.--Now I
pity the captain the most of any one in the family, answered Trim.--Madam
will get ease of heart in weeping,--and the Squire in talking about it,--
but my poor master will keep it all in silence to himself.--I shall hear
him sigh in his bed for a whole month together, as he did for lieutenant Le
Fever. An' please your honour, do not sigh so piteously, I would say to
him as I laid besides him. I cannot help it, Trim, my master would say,--
'tis so melancholy an accident--I cannot get it off my heart.--Your honour
fears not death yourself.--I hope, Trim, I fear nothing, he would say, but
the doing a wrong thing.--Well, he would add, whatever betides, I will take
care of Le Fever's boy.--And with that, like a quieting draught, his honour
would fall asleep.
I like to hear Trim's stories about the captain, said Susannah.--He is a
kindly-hearted gentleman, said Obadiah, as ever lived.--Aye, and as brave a
one too, said the corporal, as ever stept before a platoon.--There never
was a better officer in the king's army,--or a better man in God's world;
for he would march up to the mouth of a cannon, though he saw the lighted
match at the very touch-hole,--and yet, for all that, he has a heart as
soft as a child for other people.--He would not hurt a chicken.--I would
sooner, quoth Jonathan, drive such a gentleman for seven pounds a year--
than some for eight.--Thank thee, Jonathan! for thy twenty shillings,--as
much, Jonathan, said the corporal, shaking him by the hand, as if thou
hadst put the money into my own pocket.--I would serve him to the day of my
death out of love. He is a friend and a brother to me,--and could I be
sure my poor brother Tom was dead,--continued the corporal, taking out his
handkerchief,--was I worth ten thousand pounds, I would leave every
shilling of it to the captain.--Trim could not refrain from tears at this
testamentary proof he gave of his affection to his master.--The whole
kitchen was affected.--Do tell us the story of the poor lieutenant, said
Susannah.--With all my heart, answered the corporal.
Susannah, the cook, Jonathan, Obadiah, and corporal Trim, formed a circle
about the fire; and as soon as the scullion had shut the kitchen door,--the
corporal begun.
Chapter 3.XI.
I am a Turk if I had not as much forgot my mother, as if Nature had
plaistered me up, and set me down naked upon the banks of the river Nile,
without one.--Your most obedient servant, Madam--I've cost you a great deal
of trouble,--I wish it may answer;--but you have left a crack in my back,--
and here's a great piece fallen off here before,--and what must I do with
this foot?--I shall never reach England with it.
For my own part, I never wonder at any thing;--and so often has my judgment
deceived me in my life, that I always suspect it, right or wrong,--at least
I am seldom hot upon cold subjects. For all this, I reverence truth as
much as any body; and when it has slipped us, if a man will but take me by
the hand, and go quietly and search for it, as for a thing we have both
lost, and can neither of us do well without,--I'll go to the world's end
with him:--But I hate disputes,--and therefore (bating religious points, or
such as touch society) I would almost subscribe to any thing which does not
choak me in the first passage, rather than be drawn into one--But I cannot
bear suffocation,--and bad smells worst of all.--For which reasons, I
resolved from the beginning, That if ever the army of martyrs was to be
augmented,--or a new one raised,--I would have no hand in it, one way or
t'other.
Chapter 3.XII.
--But to return to my mother.
My uncle Toby's opinion, Madam, 'that there could be no harm in Cornelius
Gallus, the Roman praetor's lying with his wife;'--or rather the last word
of that opinion,--(for it was all my mother heard of it) caught hold of her
by the weak part of the whole sex:--You shall not mistake me,--I mean her
curiosity,--she instantly concluded herself the subject of the
conversation, and with that prepossession upon her fancy, you will readily
conceive every word my father said, was accommodated either to herself, or
her family concerns.
--Pray, Madam, in what street does the lady live, who would not have done
the same?
From the strange mode of Cornelius's death, my father had made a transition
to that of Socrates, and was giving my uncle Toby an abstract of his
pleading before his judges;--'twas irresistible:--not the oration of
Socrates,--but my father's temptation to it.--He had wrote the Life of
Socrates (This book my father would never consent to publish; 'tis in
manuscript, with some other tracts of his, in the family, all, or most of
which will be printed in due time.) himself the year before he left off
trade, which, I fear, was the means of hastening him out of it;--so that no
one was able to set out with so full a sail, and in so swelling a tide of
heroic loftiness upon the occasion, as my father was. Not a period in
Socrates's oration, which closed with a shorter word than transmigration,
or annihilation,--or a worse thought in the middle of it than to be--or not
to be,--the entering upon a new and untried state of things,--or, upon a
long, a profound and peaceful sleep, without dreams, without disturbance?--
That we and our children were born to die,--but neither of us born to be
slaves.--No--there I mistake; that was part of Eleazer's oration, as
recorded by Josephus (de Bell. Judaic)--Eleazer owns he had it from the
philosophers of India; in all likelihood Alexander the Great, in his
irruption into India, after he had over-run Persia, amongst the many things
he stole,--stole that sentiment also; by which means it was carried, if not
all the way by himself (for we all know he died at Babylon), at least by
some of his maroders, into Greece,--from Greece it got to Rome,--from Rome
to France,--and from France to England:--So things come round.--
By land carriage, I can conceive no other way.--
By water the sentiment might easily have come down the Ganges into the
Sinus Gangeticus, or Bay of Bengal, and so into the Indian Sea; and
following the course of trade (the way from India by the Cape of Good Hope
being then unknown), might be carried with other drugs and spices up the
Red Sea to Joddah, the port of Mekka, or else to Tor or Sues, towns at the
bottom of the gulf; and from thence by karrawans to Coptos, but three days
journey distant, so down the Nile directly to Alexandria, where the
Sentiment would be landed at the very foot of the great stair-case of the
Alexandrian library,--and from that store-house it would be fetched.--Bless
me! what a trade was driven by the learned in those days!
Chapter 3.XIII.
--Now my father had a way, a little like that of Job's (in case there ever
was such a man--if not, there's an end of the matter.--
Though, by the bye, because your learned men find some difficulty in fixing
the precise aera in which so great a man lived;--whether, for instance,
before or after the patriarchs, &c.--to vote, therefore, that he never
lived at all, is a little cruel,--'tis not doing as they would be done by,-
-happen that as it may)--My father, I say, had a way, when things went
extremely wrong with him, especially upon the first sally of his
impatience,--of wondering why he was begot,--wishing himself dead;--
sometimes worse:--And when the provocation ran high, and grief touched his
lips with more than ordinary powers--Sir, you scarce could have
distinguished him from Socrates himself.--Every word would breathe the
sentiments of a soul disdaining life, and careless about all its issues;
for which reason, though my mother was a woman of no deep reading, yet the
abstract of Socrates's oration, which my father was giving my uncle Toby,
was not altogether new to her.--She listened to it with composed
intelligence, and would have done so to the end of the chapter, had not my
father plunged (which he had no occasion to have done) into that part of
the pleading where the great philosopher reckons up his connections, his
alliances, and children; but renounces a security to be so won by working
upon the passions of his judges.--'I have friends--I have relations,--I
have three desolate children,'--says Socrates.--
--Then, cried my mother, opening the door,--you have one more, Mr. Shandy,
than I know of.
By heaven! I have one less,--said my father, getting up and walking out of
the room.
Chapter 3.XIV.
--They are Socrates's children, said my uncle Toby. He has been dead a
hundred years ago, replied my mother.
My uncle Toby was no chronologer--so not caring to advance one step but
upon safe ground, he laid down his pipe deliberately upon the table, and
rising up, and taking my mother most kindly by the hand, without saying
another word, either good or bad, to her, he led her out after my father,
that he might finish the ecclaircissement himself.
Chapter 3.XV.
Had this volume been a farce, which, unless every one's life and opinions
are to be looked upon as a farce as well as mine, I see no reason to
suppose--the last chapter, Sir, had finished the first act of it, and then
this chapter must have set off thus.
Ptr. . .r. . .r. . .ing--twing--twang--prut--trut--'tis a cursed bad
fiddle.--Do you know whether my fiddle's in tune or no?--trut. . .prut. .
.--They should be fifths.--'Tis wickedly strung--tr. . .a.e.i.o.u.-twang.--
The bridge is a mile too high, and the sound post absolutely down,--else--
trut. . .prut--hark! tis not so bad a tone.--Diddle diddle, diddle diddle,
diddle diddle, dum. There is nothing in playing before good judges,--but
there's a man there--no--not him with the bundle under his arm--the grave
man in black.--'Sdeath! not the gentleman with the sword on.--Sir, I had
rather play a Caprichio to Calliope herself, than draw my bow across my
fiddle before that very man; and yet I'll stake my Cremona to a Jew's
trump, which is the greatest musical odds that ever were laid, that I will
this moment stop three hundred and fifty leagues out of tune upon my
fiddle, without punishing one single nerve that belongs to him--Twaddle
diddle, tweddle diddle,--twiddle diddle,--twoddle diddle,--twuddle diddle,-
-prut trut--krish--krash--krush.--I've undone you, Sir,--but you see he's
no worse,--and was Apollo to take his fiddle after me, he can make him no
better.
Diddle diddle, diddle diddle, diddle diddle--hum--dum--drum.
--Your worships and your reverences love music--and God has made you all
with good ears--and some of you play delightfully yourselves--trut-prut,--
prut-trut.
O! there is--whom I could sit and hear whole days,--whose talents lie in
making what he fiddles to be felt,--who inspires me with his joys and
hopes, and puts the most hidden springs of my heart into motion.--If you
would borrow five guineas of me, Sir,--which is generally ten guineas more
than I have to spare--or you Messrs. Apothecary and Taylor, want your bills
paying,--that's your time.
Chapter 3.XVI.
The first thing which entered my father's head, after affairs were a little
settled in the family, and Susanna had got possession of my mother's green
sattin night-gown,--was to sit down coolly, after the example of Xenophon,
and write a Tristra-paedia, or system of education for me; collecting first
for that purpose his own scattered thoughts, counsels, and notions; and
binding them together, so as to form an Institute for the government of my
childhood and adolescence. I was my father's last stake--he had lost my
brother Bobby entirely,--he had lost, by his own computation, full three-
fourths of me--that is, he had been unfortunate in his three first great
casts for me--my geniture, nose, and name,--there was but this one left;
and accordingly my father gave himself up to it with as much devotion as
ever my uncle Toby had done to his doctrine of projectils.--The difference
between them was, that my uncle Toby drew his whole knowledge of projectils
from Nicholas Tartaglia--My father spun his, every thread of it, out of his
own brain,--or reeled and cross-twisted what all other spinners and
spinsters had spun before him, that 'twas pretty near the same torture to
him.
In about three years, or something more, my father had got advanced almost
into the middle of his work.--Like all other writers, he met with
disappointments.--He imagined he should be able to bring whatever he had to
say, into so small a compass, that when it was finished and bound, it might
be rolled up in my mother's hussive.--Matter grows under our hands.--Let no
man say,--'Come--I'll write a duodecimo.'
My father gave himself up to it, however, with the most painful diligence,
proceeding step by step in every line, with the same kind of caution and
circumspection (though I cannot say upon quite so religious a principle) as
was used by John de la Casse, the lord archbishop of Benevento, in
compassing his Galatea; in which his Grace of Benevento spent near forty
years of his life; and when the thing came out, it was not of above half
the size or the thickness of a Rider's Almanack.--How the holy man managed
the affair, unless he spent the greatest part of his time in combing his
whiskers, or playing at primero with his chaplain,--would pose any mortal
not let into the true secret;--and therefore 'tis worth explaining to the
world, was it only for the encouragement of those few in it, who write not
so much to be fed--as to be famous.
I own had John de la Casse, the archbishop of Benevento, for whose memory
(notwithstanding his Galatea,) I retain the highest veneration,--had he
been, Sir, a slender clerk--of dull wit--slow parts--costive head, and so
forth,--he and his Galatea might have jogged on together to the age of
Methuselah for me,--the phaenomenon had not been worth a parenthesis.--
But the reverse of this was the truth: John de la Casse was a genius of
fine parts and fertile fancy; and yet with all these great advantages of
nature, which should have pricked him forwards with his Galatea, he lay
under an impuissance at the same time of advancing above a line and a half
in the compass of a whole summer's day: this disability in his Grace arose
from an opinion he was afflicted with,--which opinion was this,--viz. that
whenever a Christian was writing a book (not for his private amusement,
but) where his intent and purpose was, bona fide, to print and publish it
to the world, his first thoughts were always the temptations of the evil
one.--This was the state of ordinary writers: but when a personage of
venerable character and high station, either in church or state, once
turned author,--he maintained, that from the very moment he took pen in
hand--all the devils in hell broke out of their holes to cajole him.--'Twas
Term-time with them,--every thought, first and last, was captious;--how
specious and good soever,--'twas all one;--in whatever form or colour it
presented itself to the imagination,--'twas still a stroke of one or other
of 'em levell'd at him, and was to be fenced off.--So that the life of a
writer, whatever he might fancy to the contrary, was not so much a state of
composition, as a state of warfare; and his probation in it, precisely that
of any other man militant upon earth,--both depending alike, not half so
much upon the degrees of his wit--as his Resistance.
My father was hugely pleased with this theory of John de la Casse,
archbishop of Benevento; and (had it not cramped him a little in his creed)
I believe would have given ten of the best acres in the Shandy estate, to
have been the broacher of it.--How far my father actually believed in the
devil, will be seen, when I come to speak of my father's religious notions,
in the progress of this work: 'tis enough to say here, as he could not
have the honour of it, in the literal sense of the doctrine--he took up
with the allegory of it; and would often say, especially when his pen was a
little retrograde, there was as much good meaning, truth, and knowledge,
couched under the veil of John de la Casse's parabolical representation,--
as was to be found in any one poetic fiction or mystic record of
antiquity.--Prejudice of education, he would say, is the devil,--and the
multitudes of them which we suck in with our mother's milk--are the devil
and all.--We are haunted with them, brother Toby, in all our lucubrations
and researches; and was a man fool enough to submit tamely to what they
obtruded upon him,--what would his book be? Nothing,--he would add,
throwing his pen away with a vengeance,--nothing but a farrago of the clack
of nurses, and of the nonsense of the old women (of both sexes) throughout
the kingdom.
This is the best account I am determined to give of the slow progress my
father made in his Tristra-paedia; at which (as I said) he was three years,
and something more, indefatigably at work, and, at last, had scarce
completed, by this own reckoning, one half of his undertaking: the
misfortune was, that I was all that time totally neglected and abandoned to
my mother; and what was almost as bad, by the very delay, the first part of
the work, upon which my father had spent the most of his pains, was
rendered entirely useless,--every day a page or two became of no
consequence.--
--Certainly it was ordained as a scourge upon the pride of human wisdom,
That the wisest of us all should thus outwit ourselves, and eternally
forego our purposes in the intemperate act of pursuing them.
In short my father was so long in all his acts of resistance,--or in other
words,--he advanced so very slow with his work, and I began to live and get
forwards at such a rate, that if an event had not happened,--which, when we
get to it, if it can be told with decency, shall not be concealed a moment
from the reader--I verily believe, I had put by my father, and left him
drawing a sundial, for no better purpose than to be buried under ground.
Chapter 3.XVII.
--'Twas nothing,--I did not lose two drops of blood by it--'twas not worth
calling in a surgeon, had he lived next door to us--thousands suffer by
choice, what I did by accident.--Doctor Slop made ten times more of it,
than there was occasion:--some men rise, by the art of hanging great
weights upon small wires,--and I am this day (August the 10th, 1761) paying
part of the price of this man's reputation.--O 'twould provoke a stone, to
see how things are carried on in this world!--The chamber-maid had left no
....... ... under the bed:--Cannot you contrive, master, quoth Susannah,
lifting up the sash with one hand, as she spoke, and helping me up into the
window-seat with the other,--cannot you manage, my dear, for a single time,
to .... ... .. ... ......?
I was five years old.--Susannah did not consider that nothing was well hung
in our family,--so slap came the sash down like lightning upon us;--Nothing
is left,--cried Susannah,--nothing is left--for me, but to run my country.-
-
My uncle Toby's house was a much kinder sanctuary; and so Susannah fled to
it.
Chapter 3.XVIII.
When Susannah told the corporal the misadventure of the sash, with all the
circumstances which attended the murder of me,--(as she called it,)--the
blood forsook his cheeks,--all accessaries in murder being principals,--
Trim's conscience told him he was as much to blame as Susannah,--and if the
doctrine had been true, my uncle Toby had as much of the bloodshed to
answer for to heaven, as either of 'em;--so that neither reason or
instinct, separate or together, could possibly have guided Susannah's steps
to so proper an asylum. It is in vain to leave this to the Reader's
imagination:--to form any kind of hypothesis that will render these
propositions feasible, he must cudgel his brains sore,--and to do it
without,--he must have such brains as no reader ever had before him.--Why
should I put them either to trial or to torture? 'Tis my own affair: I'll
explain it myself.
Chapter 3.XIX.
'Tis a pity, Trim, said my uncle Toby, resting with his hand upon the
corporal's shoulder, as they both stood surveying their works,--that we
have not a couple of field-pieces to mount in the gorge of that new
redoubt;--'twould secure the lines all along there, and make the attack on
that side quite complete:--get me a couple cast, Trim.
Your honour shall have them, replied Trim, before tomorrow morning.
It was the joy of Trim's heart, nor was his fertile head ever at a loss for
expedients in doing it, to supply my uncle Toby in his campaigns, with
whatever his fancy called for; had it been his last crown, he would have
sate down and hammered it into a paderero, to have prevented a single wish
in his master. The corporal had already,--what with cutting off the ends
of my uncle Toby's spouts--hacking and chiseling up the sides of his leaden
gutters,--melting down his pewter shaving-bason,--and going at last, like
Lewis the Fourteenth, on to the top of the church, for spare ends, &c.--he
had that very campaign brought no less than eight new battering cannons,
besides three demi-culverins, into the field; my uncle Toby's demand for
two more pieces for the redoubt, had set the corporal at work again; and no
better resource offering, he had taken the two leaden weights from the
nursery window: and as the sash pullies, when the lead was gone, were of
no kind of use, he had taken them away also, to make a couple of wheels for
one of their carriages.
He had dismantled every sash-window in my uncle Toby's house long before,
in the very same way,--though not always in the same order; for sometimes
the pullies have been wanted, and not the lead,--so then he began with the
pullies,--and the pullies being picked out, then the lead became useless,--
and so the lead went to pot too.
--A great Moral might be picked handsomely out of this, but I have not
time--'tis enough to say, wherever the demolition began, 'twas equally
fatal to the sash window.
Chapter 3.XX.
The corporal had not taken his measures so badly in this stroke of
artilleryship, but that he might have kept the matter entirely to himself,
and left Susannah to have sustained the whole weight of the attack, as she
could;--true courage is not content with coming off so.--The corporal,
whether as general or comptroller of the train,--'twas no matter,--had done
that, without which, as he imagined, the misfortune could never have
happened,--at least in Susannah's hands;--How would your honours have
behaved?--He determined at once, not to take shelter behind Susannah,--but
to give it; and with this resolution upon his mind, he marched upright into
the parlour, to lay the whole manoeuvre before my uncle Toby.
My uncle Toby had just then been giving Yorick an account of the Battle of
Steenkirk, and of the strange conduct of count Solmes in ordering the foot
to halt, and the horse to march where it could not act; which was directly
contrary to the king's commands, and proved the loss of the day.
There are incidents in some families so pat to the purpose of what is going
to follow,--they are scarce exceeded by the invention of a dramatic
writer;--I mean of ancient days.--
Trim, by the help of his fore-finger, laid flat upon the table, and the
edge of his hand striking across it at right angles, made a shift to tell
his story so, that priests and virgins might have listened to it;--and the
story being told,--the dialogue went on as follows.
Chapter 3.XXI.
--I would be picquetted to death, cried the corporal, as he concluded
Susannah's story, before I would suffer the woman to come to any harm,--
'twas my fault, an' please your honour,--not her's.
Corporal Trim, replied my uncle Toby, putting on his hat which lay upon the
table,--if any thing can be said to be a fault, when the service absolutely
requires it should be done,--'tis I certainly who deserve the blame,--you
obeyed your orders.
Had count Solmes, Trim, done the same at the battle of Steenkirk, said
Yorick, drolling a little upon the corporal, who had been run over by a
dragoon in the retreat,--he had saved thee;--Saved! cried Trim,
interrupting Yorick, and finishing the sentence for him after his own
fashion,--he had saved five battalions, an' please your reverence, every
soul of them:--there was Cutt's,--continued the corporal, clapping the
forefinger of his right hand upon the thumb of his left, and counting round
his hand,--there was Cutt's,--Mackay's,--Angus's,--Graham's,--and Leven's,
all cut to pieces;--and so had the English life-guards too, had it not been
for some regiments upon the right, who marched up boldly to their relief,
and received the enemy's fire in their faces, before any one of their own
platoons discharged a musket,--they'll go to heaven for it,--added Trim.--
Trim is right, said my uncle Toby, nodding to Yorick,--he's perfectly
right. What signified his marching the horse, continued the corporal,
where the ground was so strait, that the French had such a nation of
hedges, and copses, and ditches, and fell'd trees laid this way and that to
cover them (as they always have).--Count Solmes should have sent us,--we
would have fired muzzle to muzzle with them for their lives.--There was
nothing to be done for the horse:--he had his foot shot off however for his
pains, continued the corporal, the very next campaign at Landen.--Poor Trim
got his wound there, quoth my uncle Toby.--'Twas owing, an' please your
honour, entirely to count Solmes,--had he drubbed them soundly at
Steenkirk, they would not have fought us at Landen.--Possibly not,--Trim,
said my uncle Toby;--though if they have the advantage of a wood, or you
give them a moment's time to intrench themselves, they are a nation which
will pop and pop for ever at you.--There is no way but to march coolly up
to them,--receive their fire, and fall in upon them, pell-mell--Ding dong,
added Trim.--Horse and foot, said my uncle Toby.--Helter Skelter, said
Trim.--Right and left, cried my uncle Toby.--Blood an' ounds, shouted the
corporal;--the battle raged,--Yorick drew his chair a little to one side
for safety, and after a moment's pause, my uncle Toby sinking his voice a
note,--resumed the discourse as follows.
Chapter 3.XXII.
King William, said my uncle Toby, addressing himself to Yorick, was so
terribly provoked at count Solmes for disobeying his orders, that he would
not suffer him to come into his presence for many months after.--I fear,
answered Yorick, the squire will be as much provoked at the corporal, as
the King at the count.--But 'twould be singularly hard in this case,
continued be, if corporal Trim, who has behaved so diametrically opposite
to count Solmes, should have the fate to be rewarded with the same
disgrace:--too oft in this world, do things take that train.--I would
spring a mine, cried my uncle Toby, rising up,--and blow up my
fortifications, and my house with them, and we would perish under their
ruins, ere I would stand by and see it.--Trim directed a slight,--but a
grateful bow towards his master,--and so the chapter ends.
Chapter 3.XXIII.
--Then, Yorick, replied my uncle Toby, you and I will lead the way
abreast,--and do you, corporal, follow a few paces behind us.--And
Susannah, an' please your honour, said Trim, shall be put in the rear.--
'Twas an excellent disposition,--and in this order, without either drums
beating, or colours flying, they marched slowly from my uncle Toby's house
to Shandy-hall.
--I wish, said Trim, as they entered the door,--instead of the sash
weights, I had cut off the church spout, as I once thought to have done.--
You have cut off spouts enow, replied Yorick.
Chapter 3.XXIV.
As many pictures as have been given of my father, how like him soever in
different airs and attitudes,--not one, or all of them, can ever help the
reader to any kind of preconception of how my father would think, speak, or
act, upon any untried occasion or occurrence of life.--There was that
infinitude of oddities in him, and of chances along with it, by which
handle he would take a thing,--it baffled, Sir, all calculations.--The
truth was, his road lay so very far on one side, from that wherein most men
travelled,--that every object before him presented a face and section of
itself to his eye, altogether different from the plan and elevation of it
seen by the rest of mankind.--In other words, 'twas a different object, and
in course was differently considered:
This is the true reason, that my dear Jenny and I, as well as all the world
besides us, have such eternal squabbles about nothing.--She looks at her
outside,--I, at her in. . .. How is it possible we should agree about her
value?
Chapter 3.XXV.
'Tis a point settled,--and I mention it for the comfort of Confucius, (Mr
Shandy is supposed to mean. . ., Esq; member for. . .,--and not the Chinese
Legislator.) who is apt to get entangled in telling a plain story--that
provided he keeps along the line of his story,--he may go backwards and
forwards as he will,--'tis still held to be no digression.
This being premised, I take the benefit of the act of going backwards
myself.
Chapter 3.XXVI.
Fifty thousand pannier loads of devils--(not of the Archbishop of
Benevento's--I mean of Rabelais's devils), with their tails chopped off by
their rumps, could not have made so diabolical a scream of it, as I did--
when the accident befel me: it summoned up my mother instantly into the
nursery,--so that Susannah had but just time to make her escape down the
back stairs, as my mother came up the fore.
Now, though I was old enough to have told the story myself,--and young
enough, I hope, to have done it without malignity; yet Susannah, in passing
by the kitchen, for fear of accidents, had left it in short-hand with the
cook--the cook had told it with a commentary to Jonathan, and Jonathan to
Obadiah; so that by the time my father had rung the bell half a dozen
times, to know what was the matter above,--was Obadiah enabled to give him
a particular account of it, just as it had happened.--I thought as much,
said my father, tucking up his night-gown;--and so walked up stairs.
One would imagine from this--(though for my own part I somewhat question
it)--that my father, before that time, had actually wrote that remarkable
character in the Tristra-paedia, which to me is the most original and
entertaining one in the whole book;--and that is the chapter upon sash-
windows, with a bitter Philippick at the end of it, upon the forgetfulness
of chamber-maids.--I have but two reasons for thinking otherwise.
First, Had the matter been taken into consideration, before the event
happened, my father certainly would have nailed up the sash window for good
an' all;--which, considering with what difficulty he composed books,--he
might have done with ten times less trouble, than he could have wrote the
chapter: this argument I foresee holds good against his writing a chapter,
even after the event; but 'tis obviated under the second reason, which I
have the honour to offer to the world in support of my opinion, that my
father did not write the chapter upon sash-windows and chamber-pots, at the
time supposed,--and it is this.
--That, in order to render the Tristra-paedia complete,--I wrote the
chapter myself.
Chapter 3.XXVII.
My father put on his spectacles--looked,--took them off,--put them into the
case--all in less than a statutable minute; and without opening his lips,
turned about and walked precipitately down stairs: my mother imagined he
had stepped down for lint and basilicon; but seeing him return with a
couple of folios under his arm, and Obadiah following him with a large
reading-desk, she took it for granted 'twas an herbal, and so drew him a
chair to the bedside, that he might consult upon the case at his ease.
--If it be but right done,--said my father, turning to the Section--de sede
vel subjecto circumcisionis,--for he had brought up Spenser de Legibus
Hebraeorum Ritualibus--and Maimonides, in order to confront and examine us
altogether.--
--If it be but right done, quoth he:--only tell us, cried my mother,
interrupting him, what herbs?--For that, replied my father, you must send
for Dr. Slop.
My mother went down, and my father went on, reading the section as follows,
. . .--Very well,--said my father,. . .--nay, if it has that convenience--
and so without stopping a moment to settle it first in his mind, whether
the Jews had it from the Egyptians, or the Egyptians from the Jews,--he
rose up, and rubbing his forehead two or three times across with the palm
of his hand, in the manner we rub out the footsteps of care, when evil has
trod lighter upon us than we foreboded,--he shut the book, and walked down
stairs.--Nay, said he, mentioning the name of a different great nation upon
every step as he set his foot upon it--if the Egyptians,--the Syrians,--the
Phoenicians,--the Arabians,--the Cappadocians,--if the Colchi, and
Troglodytes did it--if Solon and Pythagoras submitted,--what is Tristram?--
Who am I, that I should fret or fume one moment about the matter?
Chapter 3.XXVIII.
Dear Yorick, said my father smiling (for Yorick had broke his rank with my
uncle Toby in coming through the narrow entry, and so had stept first into
the parlour)--this Tristram of ours, I find, comes very hardly by all his
religious rites.--Never was the son of Jew, Christian, Turk, or Infidel
initiated into them in so oblique and slovenly a manner.--But he is no
worse, I trust, said Yorick.--There has been certainly, continued my
father, the deuce and all to do in some part or other of the ecliptic, when
this offspring of mine was formed.--That, you are a better judge of than I,
replied Yorick.--Astrologers, quoth my father, know better than us both:--
the trine and sextil aspects have jumped awry,--or the opposite of their
ascendents have not hit it, as they should,--or the lords of the genitures
(as they call them) have been at bo-peep,--or something has been wrong
above, or below with us.
'Tis possible, answered Yorick.--But is the child, cried my uncle Toby, the
worse?--The Troglodytes say not, replied my father. And your theologists,
Yorick, tell us--Theologically? said Yorick,--or speaking after the manner
of apothecaries? (footnote in Greek Philo.)--statesmen? (footnote in
Greek)--or washer-women? (footnote in Greek Bochart.)
--I'm not sure, replied my father,--but they tell us, brother Toby, he's
the better for it.--Provided, said Yorick, you travel him into Egypt.--Of
that, answered my father, he will have the advantage, when he sees the
Pyramids.--
Now every word of this, quoth my uncle Toby, is Arabic to me.--I wish, said
Yorick, 'twas so, to half the world.
--Ilus, (footnote in Greek Sanchuniatho.) continued my father, circumcised
his whole army one morning.--Not without a court martial? cried my uncle
Toby.--Though the learned, continued he, taking no notice of my uncle
Toby's remark, but turning to Yorick,--are greatly divided still who Ilus
was;--some say Saturn;--some the Supreme Being;--others, no more than a
brigadier general under Pharaoh-neco.--Let him be who he will, said my
uncle Toby, I know not by what article of war he could justify it.
The controvertists, answered my father, assign two-and-twenty different
reasons for it:--others, indeed, who have drawn their pens on the opposite
side of the question, have shewn the world the futility of the greatest
part of them.--But then again, our best polemic divines--I wish there was
not a polemic divine, said Yorick, in the kingdom;--one ounce of practical
divinity--is worth a painted ship-load of all their reverences have
imported these fifty years.--Pray, Mr. Yorick, quoth my uncle Toby,--do
tell me what a polemic divine is?--The best description, captain Shandy, I
have ever read, is of a couple of 'em, replied Yorick, in the account of
the battle fought single hands betwixt Gymnast and captain Tripet; which I
have in my pocket.--I beg I may hear it, quoth my uncle Toby earnestly.--
You shall, said Yorick.--And as the corporal is waiting for me at the
door,--and I know the description of a battle will do the poor fellow more
good than his supper,--I beg, brother, you'll give him leave to come in.--
With all my soul, said my father.--Trim came in, erect and happy as an
emperor; and having shut the door, Yorick took a book from his right-hand
coat-pocket, and read, or pretended to read, as follows.
Chapter 3.XXIX.
--'which words being heard by all the soldiers which were there, divers of
them being inwardly terrified, did shrink back and make room for the
assailant: all this did Gymnast very well remark and consider; and
therefore, making as if he would have alighted from off his horse, as he
was poising himself on the mounting side, he most nimbly (with his short
sword by this thigh) shifting his feet in the stirrup, and performing the
stirrup-leather feat, whereby, after the inclining of his body downwards,
he forthwith launched himself aloft into the air, and placed both his feet
together upon the saddle, standing upright, with his back turned towards
his horse's head,--Now, (said he) my case goes forward. Then suddenly in
the same posture wherein he was, he fetched a gambol upon one foot, and
turning to the left-hand, failed not to carry his body perfectly round,
just into his former position, without missing one jot.--Ha! said Tripet, I
will not do that at this time,--and not without cause. Well, said Gymnast,
I have failed,--I will undo this leap; then with a marvellous strength and
agility, turning towards the right-hand, he fetched another striking gambol
as before; which done, he set his right hand thumb upon the bow of the
saddle, raised himself up, and sprung into the air, poising and upholding
his whole weight upon the muscle and nerve of the said thumb, and so turned
and whirled himself about three times: at the fourth, reversing his body,
and overturning it upside down, and foreside back, without touching any
thing, he brought himself betwixt the horse's two ears, and then giving
himself a jerking swing, he seated himself upon the crupper--'
(This can't be fighting, said my uncle Toby.--The corporal shook his head
at it.--Have patience, said Yorick.)
'Then (Tripet) pass'd his right leg over his saddle, and placed himself en
croup.--But, said he, 'twere better for me to get into the saddle; then
putting the thumbs of both hands upon the crupper before him, and there-
upon leaning himself, as upon the only supporters of his body, he
incontinently turned heels over head in the air, and strait found himself
betwixt the bow of the saddle in a tolerable seat; then springing into the
air with a summerset, he turned him about like a wind-mill, and made above
a hundred frisks, turns, and demi-pommadas.'--Good God! cried Trim, losing
all patience,--one home thrust of a bayonet is worth it all.--I think so
too, replied Yorick.--
I am of a contrary opinion, quoth my father.
Chapter 3.XXX.
--No,--I think I have advanced nothing, replied my father, making answer to
a question which Yorick had taken the liberty to put to him,--I have
advanced nothing in the Tristra-paedia, but what is as clear as any one
proposition in Euclid.--Reach me, Trim, that book from off the scrutoir:--
it has oft-times been in my mind, continued my father, to have read it over
both to you, Yorick, and to my brother Toby, and I think it a little
unfriendly in myself, in not having done it long ago:--shall we have a
short chapter or two now,--and a chapter or two hereafter, as occasions
serve; and so on, till we get through the whole? My uncle Toby and Yorick
made the obeisance which was proper; and the corporal, though he was not
included in the compliment, laid his hand upon his breast, and made his bow
at the same time.--The company smiled. Trim, quoth my father, has paid the
full price for staying out the entertainment.--He did not seem to relish
the play, replied Yorick.--'Twas a Tom-fool-battle, an' please your
reverence, of captain Tripet's and that other officer, making so many
summersets, as they advanced;--the French come on capering now and then in
that way,--but not quite so much.
My uncle Toby never felt the consciousness of his existence with more
complacency than what the corporal's, and his own reflections, made him do
at that moment;--he lighted his pipe,--Yorick drew his chair closer to the
table,--Trim snuff'd the candle,--my father stirr'd up the fire,--took up
the book,--cough'd twice, and begun.
Chapter 3.XXXI.
The first thirty pages, said my father, turning over the leaves,--are a
little dry; and as they are not closely connected with the subject,--for
the present we'll pass them by: 'tis a prefatory introduction, continued
my father, or an introductory preface (for I am not determined which name
to give it) upon political or civil government; the foundation of which
being laid in the first conjunction betwixt male and female, for
procreation of the species--I was insensibly led into it.--'Twas natural,
said Yorick.
The original of society, continued my father, I'm satisfied is, what
Politian tells us, i. e. merely conjugal; and nothing more than the getting
together of one man and one woman;--to which, (according to Hesiod) the
philosopher adds a servant:--but supposing in the first beginning there
were no men servants born--he lays the foundation of it, in a man,--a
woman--and a bull.--I believe 'tis an ox, quoth Yorick, quoting the passage
(Greek)--A bull must have given more trouble than his head was worth.--But
there is a better reason still, said my father (dipping his pen into his
ink); for the ox being the most patient of animals, and the most useful
withal in tilling the ground for their nourishment,--was the properest
instrument, and emblem too, for the new joined couple, that the creation
could have associated with them.--And there is a stronger reason, added my
uncle Toby, than them all for the ox.--My father had not power to take his
pen out of his ink-horn, till he had heard my uncle Toby's reason.--For
when the ground was tilled, said my uncle Toby, and made worth inclosing,
then they began to secure it by walls and ditches, which was the origin of
fortification.--True, true, dear Toby, cried my father, striking out the
bull, and putting the ox in his place.
My father gave Trim a nod, to snuff the candle, and resumed his discourse.
--I enter upon this speculation, said my father carelessly, and half
shutting the book, as he went on, merely to shew the foundation of the
natural relation between a father and his child; the right and jurisdiction
over whom he acquires these several ways--
1st, by marriage.
2d, by adoption.
3d, by legitimation.
And 4th, by procreation; all which I consider in their order.
I lay a slight stress upon one of them, replied Yorick--the act, especially
where it ends there, in my opinion lays as little obligation upon the
child, as it conveys power to the father.--You are wrong,--said my father
argutely, and for this plain reason. . ..--I own, added my father, that the
offspring, upon this account, is not so under the power and jurisdiction of
the mother.--But the reason, replied Yorick, equally holds good for her.--
She is under authority herself, said my father:--and besides, continued my
father, nodding his head, and laying his finger upon the side of his nose,
as he assigned his reason,--she is not the principal agent, Yorick.--In
what, quoth my uncle Toby? stopping his pipe.--Though by all means, added
my father (not attending to my uncle Toby), 'The son ought to pay her
respect,' as you may read, Yorick, at large in the first book of the
Institutes of Justinian, at the eleventh title and the tenth section.--I
can read it as well, replied Yorick, in the Catechism.
Chapter 3.XXXII.
Trim can repeat every word of it by heart, quoth my uncle Toby.--Pugh! said
my father, not caring to be interrupted with Trim's saying his Catechism. 
He can, upon my honour, replied my uncle Toby.--Ask him, Mr. Yorick, any
question you please.--
--The fifth Commandment, Trim,--said Yorick, speaking mildly, and with a
gentle nod, as to a modest Catechumen. The corporal stood silent.--You
don't ask him right, said my uncle Toby, raising his voice, and giving it
rapidly like the word of command:--The fifth--cried my uncle Toby.--I must
begin with the first, an' please your honour, said the corporal.--
--Yorick could not forbear smiling.--Your reverence does not consider, said
the corporal, shouldering his stick like a musket, and marching into the
middle of the room, to illustrate his position,--that 'tis exactly the same
thing, as doing one's exercise in the field.--
'Join your right-hand to your firelock,' cried the corporal, giving the
word of command, and performing the motion.--
'Poise your firelock,' cried the corporal, doing the duty still both of
adjutant and private man.
'Rest your firelock;'--one motion, an' please your reverence, you see leads
into another.--If his honour will begin but with the first--
The First--cried my uncle Toby, setting his hand upon his side--. . ..
The Second--cried my uncle Toby, waving his tobacco-pipe, as he would have
done his sword at the head of a regiment.--The corporal went through his
manual with exactness; and having honoured his father and mother, made a
low bow, and fell back to the side of the room.
Every thing in this world, said my father, is big with jest, and has wit in
it, and instruction too,--if we can but find it out.
--Here is the scaffold work of Instruction, its true point of folly,
without the Building behind it.
--Here is the glass for pedagogues, preceptors, tutors, governors, gerund-
grinders, and bear-leaders to view themselves in, in their true
dimensions.--
Oh! there is a husk and shell, Yorick, which grows up with learning, which
their unskilfulness knows not how to fling away!
--Sciences May Be Learned by Rote But Wisdom Not.
Yorick thought my father inspired.--I will enter into obligations this
moment, said my father, to lay out all my aunt Dinah's legacy in charitable
uses (of which, by the bye, my father had no high opinion), if the corporal
has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word he has repeated.--
Prithee, Trim, quoth my father, turning round to him,--What dost thou mean,
by 'honouring thy father and mother?'
Allowing them, an' please your honour, three halfpence a day out of my pay,
when they grow old.--And didst thou do that, Trim? said Yorick.--He did
indeed, replied my uncle Toby.--Then, Trim, said Yorick, springing out of
his chair, and taking the corporal by the hand, thou art the best
commentator upon that part of the Decalogue; and I honour thee more for it,
corporal Trim, than if thou hadst had a hand in the Talmud itself.
Chapter 3.XXXIII.
O blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he turned over
the leaves to the next chapter, thou art before all gold and treasure; 'tis
thou who enlargest the soul,--and openest all its powers to receive
instruction and to relish virtue.--He that has thee, has little more to
wish for;--and he that is so wretched as to want thee,--wants every thing
with thee.
I have concentrated all that can be said upon this important head, said my
father, into a very little room, therefore we'll read the chapter quite
through.
My father read as follows:
'The whole secret of health depending upon the due contention for mastery
betwixt the radical heat and the radical moisture'--You have proved that
matter of fact, I suppose, above, said Yorick. Sufficiently, replied my
father.
In saying this, my father shut the book,--not as if he resolved to read no
more of it, for he kept his fore-finger in the chapter:--nor pettishly,--
for he shut the book slowly; his thumb resting, when he had done it, upon
the upper-side of the cover, as his three fingers supported the lower side
of it, without the least compressive violence.--
I have demonstrated the truth of that point, quoth my father, nodding to
Yorick, most sufficiently in the preceding chapter.
Now could the man in the moon be told, that a man in the earth had wrote a
chapter, sufficiently demonstrating, That the secret of all health depended
upon the due contention for mastery betwixt the radical heat and the
radical moisture,--and that he had managed the point so well, that there
was not one single word wet or dry upon radical heat or radical moisture,
throughout the whole chapter,--or a single syllable in it, pro or con,
directly or indirectly, upon the contention betwixt these two powers in any
part of the animal oeconomy--
'O thou eternal Maker of all beings!'--he would cry, striking his breast
with his right hand (in case he had one)--'Thou whose power and goodness
can enlarge the faculties of thy creatures to this infinite degree of
excellence and perfection,--What have we Moonites done?'
Chapter 3.XXXIV.
With two strokes, the one at Hippocrates, the other at Lord Verulam, did my
father achieve it.
The stroke at the prince of physicians, with which he began, was no more
than a short insult upon his sorrowful complaint of the Ars longa,--and
Vita brevis.--Life short, cried my father,--and the art of healing tedious! 
And who are we to thank for both the one and the other, but the ignorance
of quacks themselves,--and the stage-loads of chymical nostrums, and
peripatetic lumber, with which, in all ages, they have first flatter'd the
world, and at last deceived it?
--O my lord Verulam! cried my father, turning from Hippocrates, and making
his second stroke at him, as the principal of nostrum-mongers, and the
fittest to be made an example of to the rest,--What shall I say to thee, my
great lord Verulam? What shall I say to thy internal spirit,--thy opium,
thy salt-petre,--thy greasy unctions,--thy daily purges,--thy nightly
clysters, and succedaneums?
--My father was never at a loss what to say to any man, upon any subject;
and had the least occasion for the exordium of any man breathing: how he
dealt with his lordship's opinion,--you shall see;--but when--I know not:--
we must first see what his lordship's opinion was.
Chapter 3.XXXV.
'The two great causes, which conspire with each other to shorten life, says
lord Verulam, are first--
'The internal spirit, which like a gentle flame wastes the body down to
death:--And secondly, the external air, that parches the body up to ashes:-
-which two enemies attacking us on both sides of our bodies together, at
length destroy our organs, and render them unfit to carry on the functions
of life.'
This being the state of the case, the road to longevity was plain; nothing
more being required, says his lordship, but to repair the waste committed
by the internal spirit, by making the substance of it more thick and dense,
by a regular course of opiates on one side, and by refrigerating the heat
of it on the other, by three grains and a half of salt-petre every morning
before you got up.--
Still this frame of ours was left exposed to the inimical assaults of the
air without;--but this was fenced off again by a course of greasy unctions,
which so fully saturated the pores of the skin, that no spicula could
enter;--nor could any one get out.--This put a stop to all perspiration,
sensible and insensible, which being the cause of so many scurvy
distempers--a course of clysters was requisite to carry off redundant
humours,--and render the system complete.
What my father had to say to my lord of Verulam's opiates, his salt-petre,
and greasy unctions and clysters, you shall read,--but not to-day--or to-
morrow: time presses upon me,--my reader is impatient--I must get
forwards--You shall read the chapter at your leisure (if you chuse it), as
soon as ever the Tristra-paedia is published.--
Sufficeth it, at present to say, my father levelled the hypothesis with the
ground, and in doing that, the learned know, he built up and established
his own.--
Chapter 3.XXXVI.
The whole secret of health, said my father, beginning the sentence again,
depending evidently upon the due contention betwixt the radical heat and
radical moisture within us;--the least imaginable skill had been sufficient
to have maintained it, had not the school-men confounded the task, merely
(as Van Helmont, the famous chymist, has proved) by all along mistaking the
radical moisture for the tallow and fat of animal bodies.
Now the radical moisture is not the tallow or fat of animals, but an oily
and balsamous substance; for the fat and tallow, as also the phlegm or
watery parts, are cold; whereas the oily and balsamous parts are of a
lively heat and spirit, which accounts for the observation of Aristotle,
'Quod omne animal post coitum est triste.'
Now it is certain, that the radical heat lives in the radical moisture, but
whether vice versa, is a doubt: however, when the one decays, the other
decays also; and then is produced, either an unnatural heat, which causes
an unnatural dryness--or an unnatural moisture, which causes dropsies.--So
that if a child, as he grows up, can but be taught to avoid running into
fire or water, as either of 'em threaten his destruction,--'twill be all
that is needful to be done upon that head.--
Chapter 3.XXXVII.
The description of the siege of Jericho itself, could not have engaged the
attention of my uncle Toby more powerfully than the last chapter;--his eyes
were fixed upon my father throughout it;--he never mentioned radical heat
and radical moisture, but my uncle Toby took his pipe out of his mouth, and
shook his head; and as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the
corporal to come close to his chair, to ask him the following question,--
aside.--. . .. It was at the siege of Limerick, an' please your honour,
replied the corporal, making a bow.
The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle Toby, addressing himself to my
father, were scarce able to crawl out of our tents, at the time the siege
of Limerick was raised, upon the very account you mention.--Now what can
have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother Toby? cried my
father, mentally.--By Heaven! continued he, communing still with himself,
it would puzzle an Oedipus to bring it in point.--
I believe, an' please your honour, quoth the corporal, that if it had not
been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night, and the claret
and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour off;--And the geneva, Trim,
added my uncle Toby , which did us more good than all--I verily believe,
continued the corporal, we had both, an' please your honour, left our lives
in the trenches, and been buried in them too.--The noblest grave, corporal!
cried my uncle Toby, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that a soldier could
wish to lie down in.--But a pitiful death for him! an' please your honour,
replied the corporal.
All this was as much Arabick to my father, as the rites of the Colchi and
Troglodites had been before to my uncle Toby; my father could not determine
whether he was to frown or to smile.
My uncle Toby, turning to Yorick, resumed the case at Limerick, more
intelligibly than he had begun it,--and so settled the point for my father
at once.
Chapter 3.XXXVIII.
It was undoubtedly, said my uncle Toby, a great happiness for myself and
the corporal, that we had all along a burning fever, attended with a most
raging thirst, during the whole five-and-twenty days the flux was upon us
in the camp; otherwise what my brother calls the radical moisture, must, as
I conceive it, inevitably have got the better.--My father drew in his lungs
top-full of air, and looking up, blew it forth again, as slowly as he
possibly could.--
--It was Heaven's mercy to us, continued my uncle Toby, which put it into
the corporal's head to maintain that due contention betwixt the radical
heat and the radical moisture, by reinforceing the fever, as he did all
along, with hot wine and spices; whereby the corporal kept up (as it were)
a continual firing, so that the radical heat stood its ground from the
beginning to the end, and was a fair match for the moisture, terrible as it
was.--Upon my honour, added my uncle Toby, you might have heard the
contention within our bodies, brother Shandy, twenty toises.--If there was
no firing, said Yorick.
Well--said my father, with a full aspiration, and pausing a while after the
word--Was I a judge, and the laws of the country which made me one
permitted it, I would condemn some of the worst malefactors, provided they
had had their clergy. . .--Yorick, foreseeing the sentence was likely to
end with no sort of mercy, laid his hand upon my father's breast, and
begged he would respite it for a few minutes, till he asked the corporal a
question.--Prithee, Trim, said Yorick, without staying for my father's
leave,--tell us honestly--what is thy opinion concerning this self-same
radical heat and radical moisture?
With humble submission to his honour's better judgment, quoth the corporal,
making a bow to my uncle Toby--Speak thy opinion freely, corporal, said my
uncle Toby.--The poor fellow is my servant,--not my slave,--added my uncle
Toby, turning to my father.--
The corporal put his hat under his left arm, and with his stick hanging
upon the wrist of it, by a black thong split into a tassel about the knot,
he marched up to the ground where he had performed his catechism; then
touching his under-jaw with the thumb and fingers of his right hand before
he opened his mouth,--he delivered his notion thus.
Chapter 3.XXXIX.
Just as the corporal was humming, to begin--in waddled Dr. Slop.--'Tis not
two-pence matter--the corporal shall go on in the next chapter, let who
will come in.--
Well, my good doctor, cried my father sportively, for the transitions of
his passions were unaccountably sudden,--and what has this whelp of mine to
say to the matter?
Had my father been asking after the amputation of the tail of a puppy-dog--
he could not have done it in a more careless air: the system which Dr.
Slop had laid down, to treat the accident by, no way allowed of such a mode
of enquiry.--He sat down.
Pray, Sir, quoth my uncle Toby, in a manner which could not go unanswered,-
-in what condition is the boy?--'Twill end in a phimosis, replied Dr. Slop.
I am no wiser than I was, quoth my uncle Toby--returning his pipe into his
mouth.--Then let the corporal go on, said my father, with his medical
lecture.--The corporal made a bow to his old friend, Dr. Slop, and then
delivered his opinion concerning radical heat and radical moisture, in the
following words.
Chapter 3.XL.
The city of Limerick, the siege of which was begun under his majesty king
William himself, the year after I went into the army--lies, an' please your
honours, in the middle of a devilish wet, swampy country.--'Tis quite
surrounded, said my uncle Toby, with the Shannon, and is, by its situation,
one of the strongest fortified places in Ireland.--
I think this is a new fashion, quoth Dr. Slop, of beginning a medical
lecture.--'Tis all true, answered Trim.--Then I wish the faculty would
follow the cut of it, said Yorick.--'Tis all cut through, an' please your
reverence, said the corporal, with drains and bogs; and besides, there was
such a quantity of rain fell during the siege, the whole country was like a
puddle,--'twas that, and nothing else, which brought on the flux, and which
had like to have killed both his honour and myself; now there was no such
thing, after the first ten days, continued the corporal, for a soldier to
lie dry in his tent, without cutting a ditch round it, to draw off the
water;--nor was that enough, for those who could afford it, as his honour
could, without setting fire every night to a pewter dish full of brandy,
which took off the damp of the air, and made the inside of the tent as warm
as a stove.--
And what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal Trim, cried my father, from
all these premises?
I infer, an' please your worship, replied Trim, that the radical moisture
is nothing in the world but ditch-water--and that the radical heat, of
those who can go to the expence of it, is burnt brandy,--the radical heat
and moisture of a private man, an' please your honour, is nothing but
ditch-water--and a dram of geneva--and give us but enough of it, with a
pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and drive away the vapours--we know
not what it is to fear death.
I am at a loss, Captain Shandy, quoth Doctor Slop, to determine in which
branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in physiology or
divinity.--Slop had not forgot Trim's comment upon the sermon.--
It is but an hour ago, replied Yorick, since the corporal was examined in
the latter, and passed muster with great honour.--
The radical heat and moisture, quoth Doctor Slop, turning to my father, you
must know, is the basis and foundation of our being--as the root of a tree
is the source and principle of its vegetation.--It is inherent in the seeds
of all animals, and may be preserved sundry ways, but principally in my
opinion by consubstantials, impriments, and occludents.--Now this poor
fellow, continued Dr. Slop, pointing to the corporal, has had the
misfortune to have heard some superficial empiric discourse upon this nice
point.--That he has,--said my father.--Very likely, said my uncle.--I'm
sure of it--quoth Yorick.--
Chapter 3.XLI.
Doctor Slop being called out to look at a cataplasm he had ordered, it gave
my father an opportunity of going on with another chapter in the Tristra-
paedia.--Come! cheer up, my lads; I'll shew you land--for when we have
tugged through that chapter, the book shall not be opened again this
twelve-month.--Huzza!--
Chapter 3.XLII.
--Five years with a bib under his chin;
Four years in travelling from Christ-cross-row to Malachi;
A year and a half in learning to write his own name;
Seven long years and more (Greek)-ing it, at Greek and Latin;
Four years at his probations and his negations--the fine statue still lying
in the middle of the marble block,--and nothing done, but his tools
sharpened to hew it out!--'Tis a piteous delay!--Was not the great Julius
Scaliger within an ace of never getting his tools sharpened at all?--Forty-
four years old was he before he could manage his Greek;--and Peter
Damianus, lord bishop of Ostia, as all the world knows, could not so much
as read, when he was of man's estate.--And Baldus himself, as eminent as he
turned out after, entered upon the law so late in life, that every body
imagined he intended to be an advocate in the other world: no wonder, when
Eudamidas, the son of Archidamas, heard Xenocrates at seventy-five
disputing about wisdom, that he asked gravely,--If the old man be yet
disputing and enquiring concerning wisdom,--what time will he have to make
use of it?
Yorick listened to my father with great attention; there was a seasoning of
wisdom unaccountably mixed up with his strangest whims, and he had
sometimes such illuminations in the darkest of his eclipses, as almost
atoned for them:--be wary, Sir, when you imitate him.
I am convinced, Yorick, continued my father, half reading and half
discoursing, that there is a North-west passage to the intellectual world;
and that the soul of man has shorter ways of going to work, in furnishing
itself with knowledge and instruction, than we generally take with it.--
But, alack! all fields have not a river or a spring running besides them;--
every child, Yorick, has not a parent to point it out.
--The whole entirely depends, added my father, in a low voice, upon the
auxiliary verbs, Mr. Yorick.
Had Yorick trod upon Virgil's snake, he could not have looked more
surprised.--I am surprised too, cried my father, observing it,--and I
reckon it as one of the greatest calamities which ever befel the republic
of letters, That those who have been entrusted with the education of our
children, and whose business it was to open their minds, and stock them
early with ideas, in order to set the imagination loose upon them, have
made so little use of the auxiliary verbs in doing it, as they have done--
So that, except Raymond Lullius, and the elder Pelegrini, the last of which
arrived to such perfection in the use of 'em, with his topics, that, in a
few lessons, he could teach a young gentleman to discourse with
plausibility upon any subject, pro and con, and to say and write all that
could be spoken or written concerning it, without blotting a word, to the
admiration of all who beheld him.--I should be glad, said Yorick,
interrupting my father, to be made to comprehend this matter. You shall,
said my father.
The highest stretch of improvement a single word is capable of, is a high
metaphor,--for which, in my opinion, the idea is generally the worse, and
not the better;--but be that as it may,--when the mind has done that with
it--there is an end,--the mind and the idea are at rest,--until a second
idea enters;--and so on.
Now the use of the Auxiliaries is, at once to set the soul a-going by
herself upon the materials as they are brought her; and by the versability
of this great engine, round which they are twisted, to open new tracts of
enquiry, and make every idea engender millions.
You excite my curiosity greatly, said Yorick.
For my own part, quoth my uncle Toby, I have given it up.--The Danes, an'
please your honour, quoth the corporal, who were on the left at the siege
of Limerick, were all auxiliaries.--And very good ones, said my uncle
Toby.--But the auxiliaries, Trim, my brother is talking about,--I conceive
to be different things.--
--You do? said my father, rising up.
Chapter 3.XLIII.
My father took a single turn across the room, then sat down, and finished
the chapter.
The verbs auxiliary we are concerned in here, continued my father, are, am;
was; have; had; do; did; make; made; suffer; shall; should; will; would;
can; could; owe; ought; used; or is wont.--And these varied with tenses,
present, past, future, and conjugated with the verb see,--or with these
questions added to them;--Is it? Was it? Will it be? Would it be? May it
be? Might it be? And these again put negatively, Is it not? Was it not?
Ought it not?--Or affirmatively,--It is; It was; It ought to be. Or
chronologically,--Has it been always? Lately? How long ago?--Or
hypothetically,--If it was? If it was not? What would follow?--If the
French should beat the English? If the Sun go out of the Zodiac?
Now, by the right use and application of these, continued my father, in
which a child's memory should be exercised, there is no one idea can enter
his brain, how barren soever, but a magazine of conceptions and conclusions
may be drawn forth from it.--Didst thou ever see a white bear? cried my
father, turning his head round to Trim, who stood at the back of his
chair:--No, an' please your honour, replied the corporal.--But thou couldst
discourse about one, Trim, said my father, in case of need?--How is it
possible, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, if the corporal never saw one?--
'Tis the fact I want, replied my father,--and the possibility of it is as
follows.
A White Bear! Very well. Have I ever seen one? Might I ever have seen
one? Am I ever to see one? Ought I ever to have seen one? Or can I ever
see one?
Would I had seen a white bear! (for how can I imagine it?)
If I should see a white bear, what should I say? If I should never see a
white bear, what then?
If I never have, can, must, or shall see a white bear alive; have I ever
seen the skin of one? Did I ever see one painted?--described? Have I
never dreamed of one?
Did my father, mother, uncle, aunt, brothers or sisters, ever see a white
bear? What would they give? How would they behave? How would the white
bear have behaved? Is he wild? Tame? Terrible? Rough? Smooth?
--Is the white bear worth seeing?--
--Is there no sin in it?--
Is it better than a Black One?
Chapter 3.XLIV.
--We'll not stop two moments, my dear Sir,--only, as we have got through
these five volumes (In the first edition, the sixth volume began with this
chapter.), (do, Sir, sit down upon a set--they are better than nothing) let
us just look back upon the country we have pass'd through.--
--What a wilderness has it been! and what a mercy that we have not both of
us been lost, or devoured by wild beasts in it!
Did you think the world itself, Sir, had contained such a number of Jack
Asses?--How they view'd and review'd us as we passed over the rivulet at
the bottom of that little valley!--and when we climbed over that hill, and
were just getting out of sight--good God! what a braying did they all set
up together!
--Prithee, shepherd! who keeps all those Jack Asses?. . ..
--Heaven be their comforter--What! are they never curried?--Are they never
taken in in winter?--Bray bray--bray. Bray on,--the world is deeply your
debtor;--louder still--that's nothing:--in good sooth, you are ill-used:--
Was I a Jack Asse, I solemnly declare, I would bray in G-sol-re-ut from
morning, even unto night.
Chapter 3.XLV.
When my father had danced his white bear backwards and forwards through
half a dozen pages, he closed the book for good an' all,--and in a kind of
triumph redelivered it into Trim's hand, with a nod to lay it upon the
'scrutoire, where he found it.--Tristram, said he, shall be made to
conjugate every word in the dictionary, backwards and forwards the same
way;--every word, Yorick, by this means, you see, is converted into a
thesis or an hypothesis;--every thesis and hypothesis have an off-spring of
propositions;--and each proposition has its own consequences and
conclusions; every one of which leads the mind on again, into fresh tracks
of enquiries and doubtings.--The force of this engine, added my father, is
incredible in opening a child's head.--'Tis enough, brother Shandy, cried
my uncle Toby, to burst it into a thousand splinters.--
I presume, said Yorick, smiling,--it must be owing to this,--(for let
logicians say what they will, it is not to be accounted for sufficiently
from the bare use of the ten predicaments)--That the famous Vincent
Quirino, amongst the many other astonishing feats of his childhood, of
which the Cardinal Bembo has given the world so exact a story,--should be
able to paste up in the public schools at Rome, so early as in the eighth
year of his age, no less than four thousand five hundred and fifty
different theses, upon the most abstruse points of the most abstruse
theology;--and to defend and maintain them in such sort, as to cramp and
dumbfound his opponents.--What is that, cried my father, to what is told us
of Alphonsus Tostatus, who, almost in his nurse's arms, learned all the
sciences and liberal arts without being taught any one of them?--What shall
we say of the great Piereskius?--That's the very man, cried my uncle Toby,
I once told you of, brother Shandy, who walked a matter of five hundred
miles, reckoning from Paris to Shevling, and from Shevling back again,
merely to see Stevinus's flying chariot.--He was a very great man! added my
uncle Toby (meaning Stevinus)--He was so, brother Toby, said my father
(meaning Piereskius)--and had multiplied his ideas so fast, and increased
his knowledge to such a prodigious stock, that, if we may give credit to an
anecdote concerning him, which we cannot withhold here, without shaking the
authority of all anecdotes whatever--at seven years of age, his father
committed entirely to his care the education of his younger brother, a boy
of five years old,--with the sole management of all his concerns.--Was the
father as wise as the son? quoth my uncle Toby:--I should think not, said
Yorick:--But what are these, continued my father--(breaking out in a kind
of enthusiasm)--what are these, to those prodigies of childhood in Grotius,
Scioppius, Heinsius, Politian, Pascal, Joseph Scaliger, Ferdinand de
Cordoue, and others--some of which left off their substantial forms at nine
years old, or sooner, and went on reasoning without them;--others went
through their classics at seven;--wrote tragedies at eight;--Ferdinand de
Cordoue was so wise at nine,--'twas thought the Devil was in him;--and at
Venice gave such proofs of his knowledge and goodness, that the monks
imagined he was Antichrist, or nothing.--Others were masters of fourteen
languages at ten,--finished the course of their rhetoric, poetry, logic,
and ethics, at eleven,--put forth their commentaries upon Servius and
Martianus Capella at twelve,--and at thirteen received their degrees in
philosophy, laws, and divinity:--but you forget the great Lipsius, quoth
Yorick, who composed a work (Nous aurions quelque interet, says Baillet, de
montrer qu'il n'a rien de ridicule s'il etoit veritable, au moins dans le
sens enigmatique que Nicius Erythraeus a ta he de lui donner. Cet auteur
dit que pour comprendre comme Lipse, il a pu composer un ouvrage le premier
jour de sa vie, il faut s'imaginer, que ce premier jour n'est pas celui de
sa naissance charnelle, mais celui au quel il a commence d'user de la
raison; il veut que c'ait ete a l'age de neuf ans; et il nous veut
persuader que ce fut en cet age, que Lipse fit un poeme.--Le tour est
ingenieux, &c. &c.) the day he was born:--They should have wiped it up,
said my uncle Toby, and said no more about it.
Chapter 3.XLVI.
When the cataplasm was ready, a scruple of decorum had unseasonably rose up
in Susannah's conscience, about holding the candle, whilst Slop tied it on;
Slop had not treated Susannah's distemper with anodynes,--and so a quarrel
had ensued betwixt them.
--Oh! oh!--said Slop, casting a glance of undue freedom in Susannah's face,
as she declined the office;--then, I think I know you, madam--You know me,
Sir! cried Susannah fastidiously, and with a toss of her head, levelled
evidently, not at his profession, but at the doctor himself,--you know me!
cried Susannah again.--Doctor Slop clapped his finger and his thumb
instantly upon his nostrils;--Susannah's spleen was ready to burst at it;--
'Tis false, said Susannah.--Come, come, Mrs. Modesty, said Slop, not a
little elated with the success of his last thrust,--If you won't hold the
candle, and look--you may hold it and shut your eyes:--That's one of your
popish shifts, cried Susannah:--'Tis better, said Slop, with a nod, than no
shift at all, young woman;--I defy you, Sir, cried Susannah, pulling her
shift sleeve below her elbow.
It was almost impossible for two persons to assist each other in a surgical
case with a more splenetic cordiality.
Slop snatched up the cataplasm--Susannah snatched up the candle;--A little
this way, said Slop; Susannah looking one way, and rowing another,
instantly set fire to Slop's wig, which being somewhat bushy and unctuous
withal, was burnt out before it was well kindled.--You impudent whore!
cried Slop,--(for what is passion, but a wild beast?)--you impudent whore,
cried Slop, getting upright, with the cataplasm in his hand;--I never was
the destruction of any body's nose, said Susannah,--which is more than you
can say:--Is it? cried Slop, throwing the cataplasm in her face;--Yes, it
is, cried Susannah, returning the compliment with what was left in the pan.
Chapter 3.XLVII.
Doctor Slop and Susannah filed cross-bills against each other in the
parlour; which done, as the cataplasm had failed, they retired into the
kitchen to prepare a fomentation for me;--and whilst that was doing, my
father determined the point as you will read.
Chapter 3.XLVIII.
You see 'tis high time, said my father, addressing himself equally to my
uncle Toby and Yorick, to take this young creature out of these women's
hands, and put him into those of a private governor. Marcus Antoninus
provided fourteen governors all at once to superintend his son Commodus's
education,--and in six weeks he cashiered five of them;--I know very well,
continued my father, that Commodus's mother was in love with a gladiator at
the time of her conception, which accounts for a great many of Commodus's
cruelties when he became emperor;--but still I am of opinion, that those
five whom Antoninus dismissed, did Commodus's temper, in that short time,
more hurt than the other nine were able to rectify all their lives long.
Now as I consider the person who is to be about my son, as the mirror in
which he is to view himself from morning to night, by which he is to adjust
his looks, his carriage, and perhaps the inmost sentiments of his heart;--I
would have one, Yorick, if possible, polished at all points, fit for my
child to look into.--This is very good sense, quoth my uncle Toby to
himself.
--There is, continued my father, a certain mien and motion of the body and
all its parts, both in acting and speaking, which argues a man well within;
and I am not at all surprised that Gregory of Nazianzum, upon observing the
hasty and untoward gestures of Julian, should foretel he would one day
become an apostate;--or that St. Ambrose should turn his Amanuensis out of
doors, because of an indecent motion of his head, which went backwards and
forwards like a flail;--or that Democritus should conceive Protagoras to be
a scholar, from seeing him bind up a faggot, and thrusting, as he did it,
the small twigs inwards.--There are a thousand unnoticed openings,
continued my father, which let a penetrating eye at once into a man's soul;
and I maintain it, added he, that a man of sense does not lay down his hat
in coming into a room,--or take it up in going out of it, but something
escapes, which discovers him.
It is for these reasons, continued my father, that the governor I make
choice of shall neither (Vid. Pellegrina.) lisp, or squint, or wink, or
talk loud, or look fierce, or foolish;--or bite his lips, or grind his
teeth, or speak through his nose, or pick it, or blow it with his fingers.-
-
He shall neither walk fast,--or slow, or fold his arms,--for that is
laziness;--or hang them down,--for that is folly; or hide them in his
pocket, for that is nonsense.--
He shall neither strike, or pinch, or tickle--or bite, or cut his nails, or
hawk, or spit, or snift, or drum with his feet or fingers in company;--nor
(according to Erasmus) shall he speak to any one in making water,--nor
shall he point to carrion or excrement.--Now this is all nonsense again,
quoth my uncle Toby to himself.--
I will have him, continued my father, cheerful, facete, jovial; at the same
time, prudent, attentive to business, vigilant, acute, argute, inventive,
quick in resolving doubts and speculative questions;--he shall be wise, and
judicious, and learned:--And why not humble, and moderate, and gentle-
tempered, and good? said Yorick:--And why not, cried my uncle Toby, free,
and generous, and bountiful, and brave?--He shall, my dear Toby, replied my
father, getting up and shaking him by his hand.--Then, brother Shandy,
answered my uncle Toby, raising himself off the chair, and laying down his
pipe to take hold of my father's other hand,--I humbly beg I may recommend
poor Le Fever's son to you;--a tear of joy of the first water sparkled in
my uncle Toby's eye, and another, the fellow to it, in the corporal's, as
the proposition was made;--you will see why when you read Le Fever's
story:--fool that I was! nor can I recollect (nor perhaps you) without
turning back to the place, what it was that hindered me from letting the
corporal tell it in his own words;--but the occasion is lost,--I must tell
it now in my own.
Chapter 3.XLIX.
The Story of Le Fever.
It was some time in the summer of that year in which Dendermond was taken
by the allies,--which was about seven years before my father came into the
country,--and about as many, after the time, that my uncle Toby and Trim
had privately decamped from my father's house in town, in order to lay some
of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities in Europe--when
my uncle Toby was one evening getting his supper, with Trim sitting behind
him at a small sideboard,--I say, sitting--for in consideration of the
corporal's lame knee (which sometimes gave him exquisite pain)--when my
uncle Toby dined or supped alone, he would never suffer the corporal to
stand; and the poor fellow's veneration for his master was such, that, with
a proper artillery, my uncle Toby could have taken Dendermond itself, with
less trouble than he was able to gain this point over him; for many a time
when my uncle Toby supposed the corporal's leg was at rest, he would look
back, and detect him standing behind him with the most dutiful respect: 
this bred more little squabbles betwixt them, than all other causes for
five-and-twenty years together--But this is neither here nor there--why do
I mention it?--Ask my pen,--it governs me,--I govern not it.
He was one evening sitting thus at his supper, when the landlord of a
little inn in the village came into the parlour, with an empty phial in his
hand, to beg a glass or two of sack; 'Tis for a poor gentleman,--I think,
of the army, said the landlord, who has been taken ill at my house four
days ago, and has never held up his head since, or had a desire to taste
any thing, till just now, that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a
thin toast,--I think, says he, taking his hand from his forehead, it would
comfort me.--
--If I could neither beg, borrow, or buy such a thing--added the landlord,-
-I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so ill.--I hope in
God he will still mend, continued he,--we are all of us concerned for him.
Thou art a good-natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my uncle Toby;
and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of sack
thyself,--and take a couple of bottles with my service, and tell him he is
heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good.
Though I am persuaded, said my uncle Toby, as the landlord shut the door,
he is a very compassionate fellow--Trim,--yet I cannot help entertaining a
high opinion of his guest too; there must be something more than common in
him, that in so short a time should win so much upon the affections of his
host;--And of his whole family, added the corporal, for they are all
concerned for him,.--Step after him, said my uncle Toby,--do Trim,--and ask
if he knows his name.
--I have quite forgot it truly, said the landlord, coming back into the
parlour with the corporal,--but I can ask his son again:--Has he a son with
him then? said my uncle Toby.--A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven
or twelve years of age;--but the poor creature has tasted almost as little
as his father; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day:-
-He has not stirred from the bed-side these two days.
My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate from
before him, as the landlord gave him the account; and Trim, without being
ordered, took away, without saying one word, and in a few minutes after
brought him his pipe and tobacco.
--Stay in the room a little, said my uncle Toby.
Trim!--said my uncle Toby, after he lighted his pipe, and smoak'd about a
dozen whiffs.--Trim came in front of his master, and made his bow;--my
uncle Toby smoak'd on, and said no more.--Corporal! said my uncle Toby--the
corporal made his bow.--My uncle Toby proceeded no farther, but finished
his pipe.
Trim! said my uncle Toby, I have a project in my head, as it is a bad
night, of wrapping myself up warm in my roquelaure, and paying a visit to
this poor gentleman.--Your honour's roquelaure, replied the corporal, has
not once been had on, since the night before your honour received your
wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St.
Nicholas;--and besides, it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with the
roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give your honour
your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear so,
replied my uncle Toby; but I am not at rest in my mind, Trim, since the
account the landlord has given me.--I wish I had not known so much of this
affair,--added my uncle Toby,--or that I had known more of it:--How shall
we manage it? Leave it, an't please your honour, to me, quoth the
corporal;--I'll take my hat and stick and go to the house and reconnoitre,
and act accordingly; and I will bring your honour a full account in an
hour.--Thou shalt go, Trim, said my uncle Toby, and here's a shilling for
thee to drink with his servant.--I shall get it all out of him, said the
corporal, shutting the door.
My uncle Toby filled his second pipe; and had it not been, that he now and
then wandered from the point, with considering whether it was not full as
well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight line, as a crooked
one,--he might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor Le Fever
and his boy the whole time he smoaked it.
Chapter 3.L.
The Story of Le Fever Continued.
It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe,
that corporal Trim returned from the inn, and gave him the following
account.
I despaired, at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back your
honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick lieutenant--Is he
in the army, then? said my uncle Toby--He is, said the corporal--And in
what regiment? said my uncle Toby--I'll tell your honour, replied the
corporal, every thing straight forwards, as I learnt it.--Then, Trim, I'll
fill another pipe, said my uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee till thou
hast done; so sit down at thy ease, Trim, in the window-seat, and begin thy
story again. The corporal made his old bow, which generally spoke as plain
as a bow could speak it--Your honour is good:--And having done that, he sat
down, as he was ordered,--and begun the story to my uncle Toby over again
in pretty near the same words.
I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back any
intelligence to your honour, about the lieutenant and his son; for when I
asked where his servant was, from whom I made myself sure of knowing every
thing which was proper to be asked,--That's a right distinction, Trim, said
my uncle Toby--I was answered, an' please your honour, that he had no
servant with him;--that he had come to the inn with hired horses, which,
upon finding himself unable to proceed (to join, I suppose, the regiment),
he had dismissed the morning after he came.--If I get better, my dear, said
he, as he gave his purse to his son to pay the man,--we can hire horses
from hence.--But alas! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, said
the landlady to me,--for I heard the death-watch all night long;--and when
he dies, the youth, his son, will certainly die with him; for he is broken-
hearted already.
I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the youth came
into the kitchen, to order the thin toast the landlord spoke of;--but I
will do it for my father myself, said the youth.--Pray let my save you the
trouble, young gentleman, said I, taking up a fork for the purpose, and
offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire, whilst I did it.--I
believe, Sir, said he, very modestly, I can please him best myself.--I am
sure, said I, his honour will not like the toast the worse for being
toasted by an old soldier.--The youth took hold of my hand, and instantly
burst into tears.--Poor youth! said my uncle Toby,--he has been bred up
from an infant in the army, and the name of a soldier, Trim, sounded in his
ears like the name of a friend;--I wish I had him here.
--I never, in the longest march, said the corporal, had so great a mind to
my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company:--What could be the matter
with me, an' please your honour? Nothing in the world, Trim, said my uncle
Toby, blowing his nose,--but that thou art a good-natured fellow.
When I gave him the toast, continued the corporal, I thought it was proper
to tell him I was captain Shandy's servant, and that your honour (though a
stranger) was extremely concerned for his father;--and that if there was
any thing in your house or cellar--(And thou might'st have added my purse
too, said my uncle Toby),--he was heartily welcome to it:--He made a very
low bow (which was meant to your honour), but no answer--for his heart was
full--so he went up stairs with the toast;--I warrant you, my dear, said I,
as I opened the kitchen-door, your father will be well again.--Mr. Yorick's
curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire,--but said not a word good or
bad to comfort the youth.--I thought it wrong; added the corporal--I think
so too, said my uncle Toby.
When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he felt himself
a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen, to let me know, that in
about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step up stairs.--I believe,
said the landlord, he is going to say his prayers,--for there was a book
laid upon the chair by his bed-side, and as I shut the door, I saw his son
take up a cushion.--
I thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. Trim, never
said your prayers at all.--I heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last
night, said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could
not have believed it.--Are you sure of it? replied the curate.--A soldier,
an' please your reverence, said I, prays as often (of his own accord) as a
parson;--and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and
for his honour too, he has the most reason to pray to God of any one in the
whole world--'Twas well said of thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby.--But when a
soldier, said I, an' please your reverence, has been standing for twelve
hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water,--or engaged,
said I, for months together in long and dangerous marches;--harassed,
perhaps, in his rear to-day;--harassing others to-morrow;--detached here;--
countermanded there;--resting this night out upon his arms;--beat up in his
shirt the next;--benumbed in his joints;--perhaps without straw in his tent
to kneel on;--must say his prayers how and when he can.--I believe, said
I,--for I was piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the army,--
I believe, an' please your reverence, said I, that when a soldier gets time
to pray,--he prays as heartily as a parson,--though not with all his fuss
and hypocrisy.--Thou shouldst not have said that, Trim, said my uncle
Toby,--for God only knows who is a hypocrite, and who is not:--At the great
and general review of us all, corporal, at the day of judgment (and not
till then)--it will be seen who has done their duties in this world,--and
who has not; and we shall be advanced, Trim, accordingly.--I hope we shall,
said Trim.--It is in the Scripture, said my uncle Toby; and I will shew it
thee to-morrow:--In the mean time we may depend upon it, Trim, for our
comfort, said my uncle Toby, that God Almighty is so good and just a
governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in it,--it will
never be enquired into, whether we have done them in a red coat or a black
one:--I hope not, said the corporal--But go on, Trim, said my uncle Toby,
with thy story.
When I went up, continued the corporal, into the lieutenant's room, which I
did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes,--he was lying in his bed
with his head raised upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a
clean white cambrick handkerchief beside it:--The youth was just stooping
down to take up the cushion, upon which I supposed he had been kneeling,--
the book was laid upon the bed,--and, as he rose, in taking up the cushion
with one hand, he reached out his other to take it away at the same time.--
Let it remain there, my dear, said the lieutenant.
He did not offer to speak to me, till I had walked up close to his bed-
side:--If you are captain Shandy's servant, said he, you must present my
thanks to your master, with my little boy's thanks along with them, for his
courtesy to me;--if he was of Levens's--said the lieutenant.--I told him
your honour was--Then, said he, I served three campaigns with him in
Flanders, and remember him,--but 'tis most likely, as I had not the honour
of any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me.--You will tell
him, however, that the person his good-nature has laid under obligations to
him, is one Le Fever, a lieutenant in Angus's--but he knows me not,--said
he, a second time, musing;--possibly he may my story--added he--pray tell
the captain, I was the ensign at Breda, whose wife was most unfortunately
killed with a musket-shot, as she lay in my arms in my tent.--I remember
the story, an't please your honour, said I, very well.--Do you so? said he,
wiping his eyes with his handkerchief--then well may I.--In saying this, he
drew a little ring out of his bosom, which seemed tied with a black ribband
about his neck, and kiss'd it twice--Here, Billy, said he,--the boy flew
across the room to the bed-side,--and falling down upon his knee, took the
ring in his hand, and kissed it too,--then kissed his father, and sat down
upon the bed and wept.
I wish, said my uncle Toby, with a deep sigh,--I wish, Trim, I was asleep.
Your honour, replied the corporal, is too much concerned;--shall I pour
your honour out a glass of sack to your pipe?--Do, Trim, said my uncle
Toby.
I remember, said my uncle Toby, sighing again, the story of the ensign and
his wife, with a circumstance his modesty omitted;--and particularly well
that he, as well as she, upon some account or other (I forget what) was
universally pitied by the whole regiment;--but finish the story thou art
upon:--'Tis finished already, said the corporal,--for I could stay no
longer,--so wished his honour a good night; young Le Fever rose from off
the bed, and saw me to the bottom of the stairs; and as we went down
together, told me, they had come from Ireland, and were on their route to
join the regiment in Flanders.--But alas! said the corporal,--the
lieutenant's last day's march is over.--Then what is to become of his poor
boy? cried my uncle Toby.
Chapter 3.LI.
The Story of Le Fever Continued.
It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honour,--though I tell it only for the
sake of those, who, when coop'd in betwixt a natural and a positive law,
know not, for their souls, which way in the world to turn themselves--That
notwithstanding my uncle Toby was warmly engaged at that time in carrying
on the siege of Dendermond, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on
so vigorously, that they scarce allowed him time to get his dinner--that
nevertheless he gave up Dendermond, though he had already made a lodgment
upon the counterscarp;--and bent his whole thoughts towards the private
distresses at the inn; and except that he ordered the garden gate to be
bolted up, by which he might be said to have turned the siege of Dendermond
into a blockade,--he left Dendermond to itself--to be relieved or not by
the French king, as the French king thought good; and only considered how
he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son.
--That kind Being, who is a friend to the friendless, shall recompence thee
for this.
Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle Toby to the corporal, as he
was putting him to bed,--and I will tell thee in what, Trim.--In the first
place, when thou madest an offer of my services to Le Fever,--as sickness
and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor
lieutenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself out of his pay,--that
thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse; because, had he stood in
need, thou knowest, Trim, he had been as welcome to it as myself.--Your
honour knows, said the corporal, I had no orders;--True, quoth my uncle
Toby,--thou didst very right, Trim, as a soldier,--but certainly very wrong
as a man.
In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse,
continued my uncle Toby,--when thou offeredst him whatever was in my
house,--thou shouldst have offered him my house too:--A sick brother
officer should have the best quarters, Trim, and if we had him with us,--we
could tend and look to him:--Thou art an excellent nurse thyself, Trim,--
and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's and his boy's, and mine
together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his legs.--
--In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby, smiling,--he might
march.--He will never march; an' please your honour, in this world, said
the corporal:--He will march; said my uncle Toby, rising up from the side
of the bed, with one shoe off:--An' please your honour, said the corporal,
he will never march but to his grave:--He shall march, cried my uncle Toby,
marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advanceing an inch,--
he shall march to his regiment.--He cannot stand it, said the corporal;--He
shall be supported, said my uncle Toby;--He'll drop at last, said the
corporal, and what will become of his boy?--He shall not drop, said my
uncle Toby, firmly.--A-well-o'day,--do what we can for him, said Trim,
maintaining his point,--the poor soul will die:--He shall not die, by G..,
cried my uncle Toby.
--The Accusing Spirit, which flew up to heaven's chancery with the oath,
blush'd as he gave it in;--and the Recording Angel, as he wrote it down,
dropp'd a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever.
Chapter 3.LII.
--My uncle Toby went to his bureau,--put his purse into his breeches pocket,
and having ordered the corporal to go early in the morning for a
physician,--he went to bed, and fell asleep.
Chapter 3.LIII.
The Story of Le Fever Continued.
The sun looked bright the morning after, to every eye in the village but Le
Fever's and his afflicted son's; the hand of death pressed heavy upon his
eye-lids,--and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its
circle,--when my uncle Toby, who had rose up an hour before his wonted
time, entered the lieutenant's room, and without preface or apology, sat
himself down upon the chair by the bed-side, and, independently of all
modes and customs, opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and
brother officer would have done it, and asked him how he did,--how he had
rested in the night,--what was his complaint,--where was his pain,--and
what he could do to help him:--and without giving him time to answer any
one of the enquiries, went on, and told him of the little plan which he had
been concerting with the corporal the night before for him.--
--You shall go home directly, Le Fever, said my uncle Toby, to my house,--
and we'll send for a doctor to see what's the matter,--and we'll have an
apothecary,--and the corporal shall be your nurse;--and I'll be your
servant, Le Fever.
There was a frankness in my uncle Toby,--not the effect of familiarity,--
but the cause of it,--which let you at once into his soul, and shewed you
the goodness of his nature; to this there was something in his looks, and
voice, and manner, superadded, which eternally beckoned to the unfortunate
to come and take shelter under him, so that before my uncle Toby had half
finished the kind offers he was making to the father, had the son
insensibly pressed up close to his knees, and had taken hold of the breast
of his coat, and was pulling it towards him.--The blood and spirits of Le
Fever, which were waxing cold and slow within him, and were retreating to
their last citadel, the heart--rallied back,--the film forsook his eyes for
a moment,--he looked up wishfully in my uncle Toby's face,--then cast a
look upon his boy,--and that ligament, fine as it was,--was never broken.--
Nature instantly ebb'd again,--the film returned to its place,--the pulse
fluttered--stopp'd--went on--throbb'd--stopp'd again--moved--stopp'd--shall
I go on?--No.
Chapter 3.LIV.
I am so impatient to return to my own story, that what remains of young Le
Fever's, that is, from this turn of his fortune, to the time my uncle Toby
recommended him for my preceptor, shall be told in a very few words in the
next chapter.--All that is necessary to be added to this chapter is as
follows.--
That my uncle Toby, with young Le Fever in his hand, attended the poor
lieutenant, as chief mourners, to his grave.
That the governor of Dendermond paid his obsequies all military honours,--
and that Yorick, not to be behind-hand--paid him all ecclesiastic--for he
buried him in his chancel:--And it appears likewise, he preached a funeral
sermon over him--I say it appears,--for it was Yorick's custom, which I
suppose a general one with those of his profession, on the first leaf of
every sermon which he composed, to chronicle down the time, the place, and
the occasion of its being preached: to this, he was ever wont to add some
short comment or stricture upon the sermon itself, seldom, indeed, much to
its credit:--For instance, This sermon upon the Jewish dispensation--I
don't like it at all;--Though I own there is a world of Water-Landish
knowledge in it;--but 'tis all tritical, and most tritically put together.-
-This is but a flimsy kind of a composition; what was in my head when I
made it?
--N.B. The excellency of this text is, that it will suit any sermon,--and
of this sermon,--that it will suit any text.--
--For this sermon I shall be hanged,--for I have stolen the greatest part
of it. Doctor Paidagunes found me out. > Set a thief to catch a thief.--
On the back of half a dozen I find written, So, so, and no more--and upon a
couple Moderato; by which, as far as one may gather from Altieri's Italian
dictionary,--but mostly from the authority of a piece of green whipcord,
which seemed to have been the unravelling of Yorick's whip-lash, with which
he has left us the two sermons marked Moderato, and the half dozen of So,
so, tied fast together in one bundle by themselves,--one may safely suppose
he meant pretty near the same thing.
There is but one difficulty in the way of this conjecture, which is this,
that the moderato's are five times better than the so, so's;--show ten
times more knowledge of the human heart;--have seventy times more wit and
spirit in them;--(and, to rise properly in my climax)--discovered a
thousand times more genius;--and to crown all, are infinitely more
entertaining than those tied up with them:--for which reason, whene'er
Yorick's dramatic sermons are offered to the world, though I shall admit
but one out of the whole number of the so, so's, I shall, nevertheless,
adventure to print the two moderato's without any sort of scruple.
What Yorick could mean by the words lentamente,--tenute,--grave,--and
sometimes adagio,--as applied to theological compositions, and with which
he has characterised some of these sermons, I dare not venture to guess.--I
am more puzzled still upon finding a l'octava alta! upon one;--Con strepito
upon the back of another;--Scicilliana upon a third;--Alla capella upon a
fourth;--Con l'arco upon this;--Senza l'arco upon that.--All I know is,
that they are musical terms, and have a meaning;--and as he was a musical
man, I will make no doubt, but that by some quaint application of such
metaphors to the compositions in hand, they impressed very distinct ideas
of their several characters upon his fancy,--whatever they may do upon that
of others.
Amongst these, there is that particular sermon which has unaccountably led
me into this digression--The funeral sermon upon poor Le Fever, wrote out
very fairly, as if from a hasty copy.--I take notice of it the more,
because it seems to have been his favourite composition--It is upon
mortality; and is tied length-ways and cross-ways with a yarn thrum, and
then rolled up and twisted round with a half-sheet of dirty blue paper,
which seems to have been once the cast cover of a general review, which to
this day smells horribly of horse drugs.--Whether these marks of
humiliation were designed,--I something doubt;--because at the end of the
sermon (and not at the beginning of it)--very different from his way of
treating the rest, he had wrote--Bravo!
--Though not very offensively,--for it is at two inches, at least, and a
half's distance from, and below the concluding line of the sermon, at the
very extremity of the page, and in that right hand corner of it, which, you
know, is generally covered with your thumb; and, to do it justice, it is
wrote besides with a crow's quill so faintly in a small Italian hand, as
scarce to solicit the eye towards the place, whether your thumb is there or
not,--so that from the manner of it, it stands half excused; and being
wrote moreover with very pale ink, diluted almost to nothing,--'tis more
like a ritratto of the shadow of vanity, than of Vanity herself--of the
two; resembling rather a faint thought of transient applause, secretly
stirring up in the heart of the composer; than a gross mark of it, coarsely
obtruded upon the world.
With all these extenuations, I am aware, that in publishing this, I do no
service to Yorick's character as a modest man;--but all men have their
failings! and what lessens this still farther, and almost wipes it away, is
this; that the word was struck through sometime afterwards (as appears from
a different tint of the ink) with a line quite across it in this manner,
BRAVO (crossed out)--as if he had retracted, or was ashamed of the opinion
he had once entertained of it.
These short characters of his sermons were always written, excepting in
this one instance, upon the first leaf of his sermon, which served as a
cover to it; and usually upon the inside of it, which was turned towards
the text;--but at the end of his discourse, where, perhaps, he had five or
six pages, and sometimes, perhaps, a whole score to turn himself in,--he
took a large circuit, and, indeed, a much more mettlesome one;--as if he
had snatched the occasion of unlacing himself with a few more frolicksome
strokes at vice, than the straitness of the pulpit allowed.--These, though
hussar-like, they skirmish lightly and out of all order, are still
auxiliaries on the side of virtue;--tell me then, Mynheer Vander
Blonederdondergewdenstronke, why they should not be printed together?
Chapter 3.LV.
When my uncle Toby had turned every thing into money, and settled all
accounts betwixt the agent of the regiment and Le Fever, and betwixt Le
Fever and all mankind,--there remained nothing more in my uncle Toby's
hands, than an old regimental coat and a sword; so that my uncle Toby found
little or no opposition from the world in taking administration. The coat
my uncle Toby gave the corporal;--Wear it, Trim, said my uncle Toby, as
long as it will hold together, for the sake of the poor lieutenant--And
this,--said my uncle Toby, taking up the sword in his hand, and drawing it
out of the scabbard as he spoke--and this, Le Fever, I'll save for thee,--
'tis all the fortune, continued my uncle Toby, hanging it up upon a crook,
and pointing to it,--'tis all the fortune, my dear Le Fever, which God has
left thee; but if he has given thee a heart to fight thy way with it in the
world,--and thou doest it like a man of honour,--'tis enough for us.
As soon as my uncle Toby had laid a foundation, and taught him to inscribe
a regular polygon in a circle, he sent him to a public school, where,
excepting Whitsontide and Christmas, at which times the corporal was
punctually dispatched for him,--he remained to the spring of the year,
seventeen; when the stories of the emperor's sending his army into Hungary
against the Turks, kindling a spark of fire in his bosom, he left his Greek
and Latin without leave, and throwing himself upon his knees before my
uncle Toby, begged his father's sword, and my uncle Toby's leave along with
it, to go and try his fortune under Eugene.--Twice did my uncle Toby forget
his wound and cry out, Le Fever! I will go with thee, and thou shalt fight
beside me--And twice he laid his hand upon his groin, and hung down his
head in sorrow and disconsolation.--
My uncle Toby took down the sword from the crook, where it had hung
untouched ever since the lieutenant's death, and delivered it to the
corporal to brighten up;--and having detained Le Fever a single fortnight
to equip him, and contract for his passage to Leghorn,--he put the sword
into his hand.--If thou art brave, Le Fever, said my uncle Toby, this will
not fail thee,--but Fortune, said he (musing a little),--Fortune may--And
if she does,--added my uncle Toby, embracing him, come back again to me, Le
Fever, and we will shape thee another course.
The greatest injury could not have oppressed the heart of Le Fever more
than my uncle Toby's paternal kindness;--he parted from my uncle Toby, as
the best of sons from the best of fathers--both dropped tears--and as my
uncle Toby gave him his last kiss, he slipped sixty guineas, tied up in an
old purse of his father's, in which was his mother's ring, into his hand,--
and bid God bless him.
Chapter 3.LVI.
Le Fever got up to the Imperial army just time enough to try what metal his
sword was made of, at the defeat of the Turks before Belgrade; but a series
of unmerited mischances had pursued him from that moment, and trod close
upon his heels for four years together after; he had withstood these
buffetings to the last, till sickness overtook him at Marseilles, from
whence he wrote my uncle Toby word, he had lost his time, his services, his
health, and, in short, every thing but his sword;--and was waiting for the
first ship to return back to him.
As this letter came to hand about six weeks before Susannah's accident, Le
Fever was hourly expected; and was uppermost in my uncle Toby's mind all
the time my father was giving him and Yorick a description of what kind of
a person he would chuse for a preceptor to me: but as my uncle Toby
thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments he
required, he forbore mentioning Le Fever's name,--till the character, by
Yorick's inter-position, ending unexpectedly, in one, who should be gentle-
tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed the image of Le Fever, and
his interest, upon my uncle Toby so forcibly, he rose instantly off his
chair; and laying down his pipe, in order to take hold of both my father's
hands--I beg, brother Shandy, said my uncle Toby, I may recommend poor Le
Fever's son to you--I beseech you do, added Yorick--He has a good heart,
said my uncle Toby--And a brave one too, an' please your honour, said the
corporal.
--The best hearts, Trim, are ever the bravest, replied my uncle Toby.--And
the greatest cowards, an' please your honour, in our regiment, were the
greatest rascals in it.--There was serjeant Kumber, and ensign--
--We'll talk of them, said my father, another time.
Chapter 3.LVII.
What a jovial and a merry world would this be, may it please your worships,
but for that inextricable labyrinth of debts, cares, woes, want, grief,
discontent, melancholy, large jointures, impositions, and lies!
Doctor Slop, like a son of a w. . ., as my father called him for it,--to
exalt himself,--debased me to death,--and made ten thousand times more of
Susannah's accident, than there was any grounds for; so that in a week's
time, or less, it was in every body's mouth, That poor Master Shandy. .
.entirely.--And Fame, who loves to double every thing,--in three days more,
had sworn, positively she saw it,--and all the world, as usual, gave credit
to her evidence--'That the nursery window had not only. . .;--but that. .
.'s also.'
Could the world have been sued like a Body-Corporate,--my father had
brought an action upon the case, and trounced it sufficiently; but to fall
foul of individuals about it--as every soul who had mentioned the affair,
did it with the greatest pity imaginable;--'twas like flying in the very
face of his best friends:--And yet to acquiesce under the report, in
silence--was to acknowledge it openly,--at least in the opinion of one half
of the world; and to make a bustle again, in contradicting it,--was to
confirm it as strongly in the opinion of the other half.--
--Was ever poor devil of a country gentleman so hampered? said my father.
I would shew him publickly, said my uncle Toby, at the market cross.
--'Twill have no effect, said my father.
Chapter 3.LVIII.
--I'll put him, however, into breeches, said my father,--let the world say
what it will.
Chapter 3.LIX.
There are a thousand resolutions, Sir, both in church and state, as well as
in matters, Madam, of a more private concern;--which, though they have
carried all the appearance in the world of being taken, and entered upon in
a hasty, hare-brained, and unadvised manner, were, notwithstanding this,
(and could you or I have got into the cabinet, or stood behind the curtain,
we should have found it was so) weighed, poized, and perpended--argued
upon--canvassed through--entered into, and examined on all sides with so
much coolness, that the Goddess of Coolness herself (I do not take upon me
to prove her existence) could neither have wished it, or done it better.
Of the number of these was my father's resolution of putting me into
breeches; which, though determined at once,--in a kind of huff, and a
defiance of all mankind, had, nevertheless, been pro'd and conn'd, and
judicially talked over betwixt him and my mother about a month before, in
two several beds of justice, which my father had held for that purpose. I
shall explain the nature of these beds of justice in my next chapter; and
in the chapter following that, you shall step with me, Madam, behind the
curtain, only to hear in what kind of manner my father and my mother
debated between themselves, this affair of the breeches,--from which you
may form an idea, how they debated all lesser matters.
Chapter 3.LX.
The ancient Goths of Germany, who (the learned Cluverius is positive) were
first seated in the country between the Vistula and the Oder, and who
afterwards incorporated the Herculi, the Bugians, and some other Vandallick
clans to 'em--had all of them a wise custom of debating every thing of
importance to their state, twice, that is,--once drunk, and once sober:--
Drunk--that their councils might not want vigour;--and sober--that they
might not want discretion.
Now my father being entirely a water-drinker,--was a long time gravelled
almost to death, in turning this as much to his advantage, as he did every
other thing which the ancients did or said; and it was not till the seventh
year of his marriage, after a thousand fruitless experiments and devices,
that he hit upon an expedient which answered the purpose;--and that was,
when any difficult and momentous point was to be settled in the family,
which required great sobriety, and great spirit too, in its determination,-
-he fixed and set apart the first Sunday night in the month, and the
Saturday night which immediately preceded it, to argue it over, in bed with
my mother: By which contrivance, if you consider, Sir, with yourself,. .
..
These my father, humorously enough, called his beds of justice;--for from
the two different counsels taken in these two different humours, a middle
one was generally found out which touched the point of wisdom as well, as
if he had got drunk and sober a hundred times.
I must not be made a secret of to the world, that this answers full as well
in literary discussions, as either in military or conjugal; but it is not
every author that can try the experiment as the Goths and Vandals did it--
or, if he can, may it be always for his body's health; and to do it, as my
father did it,--am I sure it would be always for his soul's.
My way is this:--
In all nice and ticklish discussions,--(of which, heaven knows, there are
but too many in my book)--where I find I cannot take a step without the
danger of having either their worships or their reverences upon my back--I
write one-half full,--and t'other fasting;--or write it all full,--and
correct it fasting;--or write it fasting,--and correct it full, for they
all come to the same thing:--So that with a less variation from my father's
plan, than my father's from the Gothick--I feel myself upon a par with him
in his first bed of justice,--and no way inferior to him in his second.--
These different and almost irreconcileable effects, flow uniformly from the
wise and wonderful mechanism of nature,--of which,--be her's the honour.--
All that we can do, is to turn and work the machine to the improvement and
better manufactory of the arts and sciences.--
Now, when I write full,--I write as if I was never to write fasting again
as long as I live;--that is, I write free from the cares as well as the
terrors of the world.--I count not the number of my scars,--nor does my
fancy go forth into dark entries and bye-corners to ante-date my stabs.--In
a word, my pen takes its course; and I write on as much from the fulness of
my heart, as my stomach.--
But when, an' please your honours, I indite fasting, 'tis a different
history.--I pay the world all possible attention and respect,--and have as
great a share (whilst it lasts) of that under strapping virtue of
discretion as the best of you.--So that betwixt both, I write a careless
kind of a civil, nonsensical, good-humoured Shandean book, which will do
all your hearts good--
--And all your heads too,--provided you understand it.
Chapter 3.LXI.
We should begin, said my father, turning himself half round in bed, and
shifting his pillow a little towards my mother's, as he opened the debate--
We should begin to think, Mrs. Shandy, of putting this boy into breeches.--
We should so,--said my mother.--We defer it, my dear, quoth my father,
shamefully.--
I think we do, Mr. Shandy,--said my mother.
--Not but the child looks extremely well, said my father, in his vests and
tunicks.--
--He does look very well in them,--replied my mother.--
--And for that reason it would be almost a sin, added my father, to take
him out of 'em.--
--It would so,--said my mother:--But indeed he is growing a very tall lad,-
-rejoined my father.
--He is very tall for his age, indeed,--said my mother.--
--I can not (making two syllables of it) imagine, quoth my father, who the
deuce he takes after.--
I cannot conceive, for my life, said my mother.--
Humph!--said my father.
(The dialogue ceased for a moment.)
--(I am very short myself,--continued my father gravely.
You are very short, Mr. Shandy,--said my mother.
Humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering which, he
plucked his pillow a little further from my mother's,--and turning about
again, there was an end of the debate for three minutes and a half.
--When he gets these breeches made, cried my father in a higher tone, he'll
look like a beast in 'em.
He will be very awkward in them at first, replied my mother.
--And 'twill be lucky, if that's the worst on't, added my father.
It will be very lucky, answered my mother.
I suppose, replied my father,--making some pause first,--he'll be exactly
like other people's children.--
Exactly, said my mother.--
--Though I shall be sorry for that, added my father: and so the debate
stopp'd again.--
--They should be of leather, said my father, turning him about again.--
They will last him, said my mother, the longest.
But he can have no linings to 'em, replied my father.--
He cannot, said my mother.
'Twere better to have them of fustian, quoth my father.
Nothing can be better, quoth my mother.--
--Except dimity,--replied my father:--'Tis best of all,--replied my mother.
--One must not give him his death, however,--interrupted my father.
By no means, said my mother:--and so the dialogue stood still again.
I am resolved, however, quoth my father, breaking silence the fourth time,
he shall have no pockets in them.--
--There is no occasion for any, said my mother.--
I mean in his coat and waistcoat,--cried my father.
--I mean so too,--replied my mother.
--Though if he gets a gig or top--Poor souls! it is a crown and a sceptre
to them,--they should have where to secure it.--
Order it as you please, Mr. Shandy, replied my mother.--
--But don't you think it right? added my father, pressing the point home to
her.
Perfectly, said my mother, if it pleases you, Mr. Shandy.--
--There's for you! cried my father, losing his temper--Pleases me!--You
never will distinguish, Mrs. Shandy, nor shall I ever teach you to do it,
betwixt a point of pleasure and a point of convenience.--This was on the
Sunday night:--and further this chapter sayeth not.
Chapter 3.LXII.
After my father had debated the affair of the breeches with my mother,--he
consulted Albertus Rubenius upon it; and Albertus Rubenius used my father
ten times worse in the consultation (if possible) than even my father had
used my mother: For as Rubenius had wrote a quarto express, De re
Vestiaria Veterum,--it was Rubenius's business to have given my father some
lights.--On the contrary, my father might as well have thought of
extracting the seven cardinal virtues out of a long beard,--as of
extracting a single word out of Rubenius upon the subject.
Upon every other article of ancient dress, Rubenius was very communicative
to my father;--gave him a full satisfactory account of
The Toga, or loose gown.
The Chlamys.
The Ephod.
The Tunica, or Jacket.
The Synthesis.
The Paenula.
The Lacema, with its Cucullus.
The Paludamentum.
The Praetexta.
The Sagum, or soldier's jerkin.
The Trabea: of which, according to Suetonius, there was three kinds.--
--But what are all these to the breeches? said my father.
Rubenius threw him down upon the counter all kinds of shoes which had been
in fashion with the Romans.--
There was,
The open shoe.
The close shoe.
The slip shoe.
The wooden shoe.
The soc.
The buskin.
And The military shoe with hobnails in it, which Juvenal takes notice of.
There were,
The clogs.
The pattins.
The pantoufles.
The brogues.
The sandals, with latchets to them.
There was,
The felt shoe.
The linen shoe.
The laced shoe.
The braided shoe.
The calceus incisus.
And The calceus rostratus.
Rubenius shewed my father how well they all fitted,--in what manner they
laced on,--with what points, straps, thongs, latchets, ribbands, jaggs, and
ends.--
--But I want to be informed about the breeches, said my father.
Albertus Rubenius informed my father that the Romans manufactured stuffs of
various fabrics,--some plain,--some striped,--others diapered throughout
the whole contexture of the wool, with silk and gold--That linen did not
begin to be in common use till towards the declension of the empire, when
the Egyptians coming to settle amongst them, brought it into vogue.
--That persons of quality and fortune distinguished themselves by the
fineness and whiteness of their clothes; which colour (next to purple,
which was appropriated to the great offices) they most affected, and wore
on their birth-days and public rejoicings.--That it appeared from the best
historians of those times, that they frequently sent their clothes to the
fuller, to be clean'd and whitened:--but that the inferior people, to avoid
that expence, generally wore brown clothes, and of a something coarser
texture,--till towards the beginning of Augustus's reign, when the slave
dressed like his master, and almost every distinction of habiliment was
lost, but the Latus Clavus.
And what was the Latus Clavus? said my father.
Rubenius told him, that the point was still litigating amongst the
learned:--That Egnatius, Sigonius, Bossius Ticinensis, Bayfius Budaeus,
Salmasius, Lipsius, Lazius, Isaac Casaubon, and Joseph Scaliger, all
differed from each other,--and he from them: That some took it to be the
button,--some the coat itself,--others only the colour of it;--That the
great Bayfuis in his Wardrobe of the Ancients, chap. 12--honestly said, he
knew not what it was,--whether a tibula,--a stud,--a button,--a loop,--a
buckle,--or clasps and keepers.--
--My father lost the horse, but not the saddle--They are hooks and eyes,
said my father--and with hooks and eyes he ordered my breeches to be made.
Chapter 3.LXIII.
We are now going to enter upon a new scene of events.--
--Leave we then the breeches in the taylor's hands, with my father standing
over him with his cane, reading him as he sat at work a lecture upon the
latus clavus, and pointing to the precise part of the waistband, where he
was determined to have it sewed on.--
Leave we my mother--(truest of all the Poco-curante's of her sex!)--
careless about it, as about every thing else in the world which concerned
her;--that is,--indifferent whether it was done this way or that,--provided
it was but done at all.--
Leave we Slop likewise to the full profits of all my dishonours.--
Leave we poor Le Fever to recover, and get home from Marseilles as he can.-
-And last of all,--because the hardest of all--
Let us leave, if possible, myself:--But 'tis impossible,--I must go along
with you to the end of the work.
Chapter 3.LXIV.
If the reader has not a clear conception of the rood and the half of ground
which lay at the bottom of my uncle Toby's kitchen-garden, and which was
the scene of so many of his delicious hours,--the fault is not in me,--but
in his imagination;--for I am sure I gave him so minute a description, I
was almost ashamed of it.
When Fate was looking forwards one afternoon, into the great transactions
of future times,--and recollected for what purposes this little plot, by a
decree fast bound down in iron, had been destined,--she gave a nod to
Nature,--'twas enough--Nature threw half a spade full of her kindliest
compost upon it, with just so much clay in it, as to retain the forms of
angles and indentings,--and so little of it too, as not to cling to the
spade, and render works of so much glory, nasty in foul weather.
My uncle Toby came down, as the reader has been informed, with plans along
with him, of almost every fortified town in Italy and Flanders; so let the
duke of Marlborough, or the allies, have set down before what town they
pleased, my uncle Toby was prepared for them.
His way, which was the simplest one in the world, was this; as soon as ever
a town was invested--(but sooner when the design was known) to take the
plan of it (let it be what town it would), and enlarge it upon a scale to
the exact size of his bowling-green; upon the surface of which, by means of
a large role of packthread, and a number of small piquets driven into the
ground, at the several angles and redans, he transferred the lines from his
paper; then taking the profile of the place, with its works, to determine
the depths and slopes of the ditches,--the talus of the glacis, and the
precise height of the several banquets, parapets, &c.--he set the corporal
to work--and sweetly went it on:--The nature of the soil,--the nature of
the work itself,--and above all, the good-nature of my uncle Toby sitting
by from morning to night, and chatting kindly with the corporal upon past-
done deeds,--left Labour little else but the ceremony of the name.
When the place was finished in this manner, and put into a proper posture
of defence,--it was invested,--and my uncle Toby and the corporal began to
run their first parallel.--I beg I may not be interrupted in my story, by
being told, That the first parallel should be at least three hundred toises
distant from the main body of the place,--and that I have not left a single
inch for it;--for my uncle Toby took the liberty of incroaching upon his
kitchen-garden, for the sake of enlarging his works on the bowling-green,
and for that reason generally ran his first and second parallels betwixt
two rows of his cabbages and his cauliflowers; the conveniences and
inconveniences of which will be considered at large in the history of my
uncle Toby's and the corporal's campaigns, of which, this I'm now writing
is but a sketch, and will be finished, if I conjecture right, in three
pages (but there is no guessing)--The campaigns themselves will take up as
many books; and therefore I apprehend it would be hanging too great a
weight of one kind of matter in so flimsy a performance as this, to
rhapsodize them, as I once intended, into the body of the work--surely they
had better be printed apart,--we'll consider the affair--so take the
following sketch of them in the mean time.
Chapter 3.LXV.
When the town, with its works, was finished, my uncle Toby and the corporal
began to run their first parallel--not at random, or any how--but from the
same points and distances the allies had begun to run theirs; and
regulating their approaches and attacks, by the accounts my uncle Toby
received from the daily papers,--they went on, during the whole siege, step
by step with the allies.
When the duke of Marlborough made a lodgment,--my uncle Toby made a
lodgment too.--And when the face of a bastion was battered down, or a
defence ruined,--the corporal took his mattock and did as much,--and so
on;--gaining ground, and making themselves masters of the works one after
another, till the town fell into their hands.
To one who took pleasure in the happy state of others,--there could not
have been a greater sight in world, than on a post morning, in which a
practicable breach had been made by the duke of Marlborough, in the main
body of the place,--to have stood behind the horn-beam hedge, and observed
the spirit with which my uncle Toby, with Trim behind him, sallied forth;--
the one with the Gazette in his hand,--the other with a spade on his
shoulder to execute the contents.--What an honest triumph in my uncle
Toby's looks as he marched up to the ramparts! What intense pleasure
swimming in his eye as he stood over the corporal, reading the paragraph
ten times over to him, as he was at work, lest, peradventure, he should
make the breach an inch too wide,--or leave it an inch too narrow.--But
when the chamade was beat, and the corporal helped my uncle up it, and
followed with the colours in his hand, to fix them upon the ramparts--
Heaven! Earth! Sea!--but what avails apostrophes?--with all your elements,
wet or dry, ye never compounded so intoxicating a draught.
In this track of happiness for many years, without one interruption to it,
except now and then when the wind continued to blow due west for a week or
ten days together, which detained the Flanders mail, and kept them so long
in torture,--but still 'twas the torture of the happy--In this track, I
say, did my uncle Toby and Trim move for many years, every year of which,
and sometimes every month, from the invention of either the one or the
other of them, adding some new conceit or quirk of improvement to their
operations, which always opened fresh springs of delight in carrying them
on.
The first year's campaign was carried on from beginning to end, in the
plain and simple method I've related.
In the second year, in which my uncle Toby took Liege and Ruremond, he
thought he might afford the expence of four handsome draw-bridges; of two
of which I have given an exact description in the former part of my work.
At the latter end of the same year he added a couple of gates with port-
cullises:--These last were converted afterwards into orgues, as the better
thing; and during the winter of the same year, my uncle Toby, instead of a
new suit of clothes, which he always had at Christmas, treated himself with
a handsome sentry-box, to stand at the corner of the bowling-green, betwixt
which point and the foot of the glacis, there was left a little kind of an
esplanade for him and the corporal to confer and hold councils of war upon.
--The sentry-box was in case of rain.
All these were painted white three times over the ensuing spring, which
enabled my uncle Toby to take the field with great splendour.
My father would often say to Yorick, that if any mortal in the whole
universe had done such a thing except his brother Toby, it would have been
looked upon by the world as one of the most refined satires upon the parade
and prancing manner in which Lewis XIV. from the beginning of the war, but
particularly that very year, had taken the field--But 'tis not my brother
Toby's nature, kind soul! my father would add, to insult any one.
--But let us go on.
Chapter 3.LXVI.
I must observe, that although in the first year's campaign, the word town
is often mentioned,--yet there was no town at that time within the polygon;
that addition was not made till the summer following the spring in which
the bridges and sentry-box were painted, which was the third year of my
uncle Toby's campaigns,--when upon his taking Amberg, Bonn, and Rhinberg,
and Huy and Limbourg, one after another, a thought came into the corporal's
head, that to talk of taking so many towns, without one Town to shew for
it,--was a very nonsensical way of going to work, and so proposed to my
uncle Toby, that they should have a little model of a town built for them,-
-to be run up together of slit deals, and then painted, and clapped within
the interior polygon to serve for all.
My uncle Toby felt the good of the project instantly, and instantly agreed
to it, but with the addition of two singular improvements, of which he was
almost as proud as if he had been the original inventor of the project
itself.
The one was, to have the town built exactly in the style of those of which
it was most likely to be the representative:--with grated windows, and the
gable ends of the houses, facing the streets, &c. &c.--as those in Ghent
and Bruges, and the rest of the towns in Brabant and Flanders.
The other was, not to have the houses run up together, as the corporal
proposed, but to have every house independent, to hook on, or off, so as to
form into the plan of whatever town they pleased. This was put directly
into hand, and many and many a look of mutual congratulation was exchanged
between my uncle Toby and the corporal, as the carpenter did the work.
--It answered prodigiously the next summer--the town was a perfect Proteus-
-It was Landen, and Trerebach, and Santvliet, and Drusen, and Hagenau,--and
then it was Ostend and Menin, and Aeth and Dendermond.
--Surely never did any Town act so many parts, since Sodom and Gomorrah, as
my uncle Toby's town did.
In the fourth year, my uncle Toby thinking a town looked foolishly without
a church, added a very fine one with a steeple.--Trim was for having bells
in it;--my uncle Toby said, the metal had better be cast into cannon.
This led the way the next campaign for half a dozen brass field-pieces, to
be planted three and three on each side of my uncle Toby's sentry-box; and
in a short time, these led the way for a train of somewhat larger,--and so
on--(as must always be the case in hobby-horsical affairs) from pieces of
half an inch bore, till it came at last to my father's jack boots.
The next year, which was that in which Lisle was besieged, and at the close
of which both Ghent and Bruges fell into our hands,--my uncle Toby was
sadly put to it for proper ammunition;--I say proper ammunition--because
his great artillery would not bear powder; and 'twas well for the Shandy
family they would not--For so full were the papers, from the beginning to
the end of the siege, of the incessant firings kept up by the besiegers,--
and so heated was my uncle Toby's imagination with the accounts of them,
that he had infallibly shot away all his estate.
Something therefore was wanting as a succedaneum, especially in one or two
of the more violent paroxysms of the siege, to keep up something like a
continual firing in the imagination,--and this something, the corporal,
whose principal strength lay in invention, supplied by an entire new system
of battering of his own,--without which, this had been objected to by
military critics, to the end of the world, as one of the great desiderata
of my uncle Toby's apparatus.
This will not be explained the worse, for setting off, as I generally do,
at a little distance from the subject.
Chapter 3.LXVII.
With two or three other trinkets, small in themselves, but of great regard,
which poor Tom, the corporal's unfortunate brother, had sent him over, with
the account of his marriage with the Jew's widow--there was
A Montero-cap and two Turkish tobacco-pipes.
The Montero-cap I shall describe by and bye.--The Turkish tobacco-pipes had
nothing particular in them, they were fitted up and ornamented as usual,
with flexible tubes of Morocco leather and gold wire, and mounted at their
ends, the one of them with ivory,--the other with black ebony, tipp'd with
silver.
My father, who saw all things in lights different from the rest of the
world, would say to the corporal, that he ought to look upon these two
presents more as tokens of his brother's nicety, than his affection.--Tom
did not care, Trim, he would say, to put on the cap, or to smoke in the
tobacco-pipe of a Jew.--God bless your honour, the corporal would say
(giving a strong reason to the contrary)--how can that be?
The Montero-cap was scarlet, of a superfine Spanish cloth, dyed in grain,
and mounted all round with fur, except about four inches in the front,
which was faced with a light blue, slightly embroidered,--and seemed to
have been the property of a Portuguese quarter-master, not of foot, but of
horse, as the word denotes.
The corporal was not a little proud of it, as well for its own sake, as the
sake of the giver, so seldom or never put it on but upon Gala-days; and yet
never was a Montero-cap put to so many uses; for in all controverted
points, whether military or culinary, provided the corporal was sure he was
in the right,--it was either his oath,--his wager,--or his gift.
--'Twas his gift in the present case.
I'll be bound, said the corporal, speaking to himself, to give away my
Montero-cap to the first beggar who comes to the door, if I do not manage
this matter to his honour's satisfaction.
The completion was no further off, than the very next morning; which was
that of the storm of the counterscarp betwixt the Lower Deule, to the
right, and the gate St. Andrew,--and on the left, between St. Magdalen's
and the river.
As this was the most memorable attack in the whole war,--the most gallant
and obstinate on both sides,--and I must add the most bloody too, for it
cost the allies themselves that morning above eleven hundred men,--my uncle
Toby prepared himself for it with a more than ordinary solemnity.
The eve which preceded, as my uncle Toby went to bed, he ordered his
ramallie wig, which had laid inside out for many years in the corner of an
old campaigning trunk, which stood by his bedside, to be taken out and laid
upon the lid of it, ready for the morning;--and the very first thing he did
in his shirt, when he had stepped out of bed, my uncle Toby, after he had
turned the rough side outwards,--put it on:--This done, he proceeded next
to his breeches, and having buttoned the waist-band, he forthwith buckled
on his sword-belt, and had got his sword half way in,--when he considered
he should want shaving, and that it would be very inconvenient doing it
with his sword on,--so took it off:--In essaying to put on his regimental
coat and waistcoat, my uncle Toby found the same objection in his wig,--so
that went off too:--So that what with one thing and what with another, as
always falls out when a man is in the most haste,--'twas ten o'clock, which
was half an hour later than his usual time, before my uncle Toby sallied
out.
Chapter 3.LXVIII.
My uncle Toby had scarce turned the corner of his yew hedge, which
separated his kitchen-garden from his bowling-green, when he perceived the
corporal had begun the attack without him.--
Let me stop and give you a picture of the corporal's apparatus; and of the
corporal himself in the height of his attack, just as it struck my uncle
Toby, as he turned towards the sentry-box, where the corporal was at work,-
-for in nature there is not such another,--nor can any combination of all
that is grotesque and whimsical in her works produce its equal.
The corporal--
--Tread lightly on his ashes, ye men of genius,--for he was your kinsman:
Weed his grave clean, ye men of goodness,--for he was your brother.--Oh
corporal! had I thee, but now,--now, that I am able to give thee a dinner
and protection,--how would I cherish thee! thou should'st wear thy Montero-
cap every hour of the day, and every day of the week.--and when it was worn
out, I would purchase thee a couple like it:--But alas! alas! alas! now
that I can do this in spite of their reverences--the occasion is lost--for
thou art gone;--thy genius fled up to the stars from whence it came;--and
that warm heart of thine, with all its generous and open vessels,
compressed into a clod of the valley!
--But what--what is this, to that future and dreaded page, where I look
towards the velvet pall, decorated with the military ensigns of thy master-
-the first--the foremost of created beings;--where, I shall see thee,
faithful servant! laying his sword and scabbard with a trembling hand
across his coffin, and then returning pale as ashes to the door, to take
his mourning horse by the bridle, to follow his hearse, as he directed
thee;--where--all my father's systems shall be baffled by his sorrows; and,
in spite of his philosophy, I shall behold him, as he inspects the lackered
plate, twice taking his spectacles from off his nose, to wipe away the dew
which nature has shed upon them--When I see him cast in the rosemary with
an air of disconsolation, which cries through my ears,--O Toby! in what
corner of the world shall I seek thy fellow?
--Gracious powers! which erst have opened the lips of the dumb in his
distress, and made the tongue of the stammerer speak plain--when I shall
arrive at this dreaded page, deal not with me, then, with a stinted hand.
Chapter 3.LXIX.
The corporal, who the night before had resolved in his mind to supply the
grand desideratum, of keeping up something like an incessant firing upon
the enemy during the heat of the attack,--had no further idea in his fancy
at that time, than a contrivance of smoking tobacco against the town, out
of one of my uncle Toby's six field-pieces, which were planted on each side
of his sentry-box; the means of effecting which occurring to his fancy at
the same time, though he had pledged his cap, he thought it in no danger
from the miscarriage of his projects.
Upon turning it this way, and that, a little in his mind, he soon began to
find out, that by means of his two Turkish tobacco-pipes, with the
supplement of three smaller tubes of wash-leather at each of their lower
ends, to be tagg'd by the same number of tin-pipes fitted to the touch-
holes, and sealed with clay next the cannon, and then tied hermetically
with waxed silk at their several insertions into the Morocco tube,--he
should be able to fire the six field-pieces all together, and with the same
ease as to fire one.--
--Let no man say from what taggs and jaggs hints may not be cut out for the
advancement of human knowledge. Let no man, who has read my father's first
and second beds of justice, ever rise up and say again, from collision of
what kinds of bodies light may or may not be struck out, to carry the arts
and sciences up to perfection.--Heaven! thou knowest how I love them;--thou
knowest the secrets of my heart, and that I would this moment give my
shirt--Thou art a fool, Shandy, says Eugenius, for thou hast but a dozen in
the world,--and 'twill break thy set.--
No matter for that, Eugenius; I would give the shirt off my back to be
burnt into tinder, were it only to satisfy one feverish enquirer, how many
sparks at one good stroke, a good flint and steel could strike into the
tail of it.--Think ye not that in striking these in,--he might, per-
adventure, strike something out? as sure as a gun.--
--But this project, by the bye.
The corporal sat up the best part of the night, in bringing his to
perfection; and having made a sufficient proof of his cannon, with charging
them to the top with tobacco,--he went with contentment to bed.
Chapter 3.LXX.
The corporal had slipped out about ten minutes before my uncle Toby, in
order to fix his apparatus, and just give the enemy a shot or two before my
uncle Toby came.
He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up together in
front of my uncle Toby's sentry-box, leaving only an interval of about a
yard and a half betwixt the three, on the right and left, for the
convenience of charging, &c.--and the sake possibly of two batteries, which
he might think double the honour of one.
In the rear and facing this opening, with his back to the door of the
sentry-box, for fear of being flanked, had the corporal wisely taken his
post:--He held the ivory pipe, appertaining to the battery on the right,
betwixt the finger and thumb of his right hand,--and the ebony pipe tipp'd
with silver, which appertained to the battery on the left, betwixt the
finger and thumb of the other--and with his right knee fixed firm upon the
ground, as if in the front rank of his platoon, was the corporal, with his
Montero-cap upon his head, furiously playing off his two cross batteries at
the same time against the counter-guard, which faced the counterscarp,
where the attack was to be made that morning. His first intention, as I
said, was no more than giving the enemy a single puff or two;--but the
pleasure of the puffs, as well as the puffing, had insensibly got hold of
the corporal, and drawn him on from puff to puff, into the very height of
the attack, by the time my uncle Toby joined him.
'Twas well for my father, that my uncle Toby had not his will to make that
day.
Chapter 3.LXXI.
My uncle Toby took the ivory pipe out of the corporal's hand,--looked at it
for half a minute, and returned it.
In less than two minutes, my uncle Toby took the pipe from the corporal
again, and raised it half way to his mouth--then hastily gave it back a
second time.
The corporal redoubled the attack,--my uncle Toby smiled,--then looked
grave,--then smiled for a moment,--then looked serious for a long time;--
Give me hold of the ivory pipe, Trim, said my uncle Toby--my uncle Toby put
it to his lips,--drew it back directly,--gave a peep over the horn-beam
hedge;--never did my uncle Toby's mouth water so much for a pipe in his
life.--My uncle Toby retired into the sentry-box with the pipe in his
hand.--
--Dear uncle Toby! don't go into the sentry-box with the pipe,--there's no
trusting a man's self with such a thing in such a corner.
Chapter 3.LXXII.
I beg the reader will assist me here, to wheel off my uncle Toby's ordnance
behind the scenes,--to remove his sentry-box, and clear the theatre, if
possible, of horn-works and half moons, and get the rest of his military
apparatus out of the way;--that done, my dear friend Garrick, we'll snuff
the candles bright,--sweep the stage with a new broom,--draw up the
curtain, and exhibit my uncle Toby dressed in a new character, throughout
which the world can have no idea how he will act: and yet, if pity be a-
kin to love,--and bravery no alien to it, you have seen enough of my uncle
Toby in these, to trace these family likenesses, betwixt the two passions
(in case there is one) to your heart's content.
Vain science! thou assistest us in no case of this kind--and thou puzzlest
us in every one.
There was, Madam, in my uncle Toby, a singleness of heart which misled him
so far out of the little serpentine tracks in which things of this nature
usually go on; you can--you can have no conception of it: with this, there
was a plainness and simplicity of thinking, with such an unmistrusting
ignorance of the plies and foldings of the heart of woman;--and so naked
and defenceless did he stand before you, (when a siege was out of his
head,) that you might have stood behind any one of your serpentine walks,
and shot my uncle Toby ten times in a day, through his liver, if nine times
in a day, Madam, had not served your purpose.
With all this, Madam,--and what confounded every thing as much on the other
hand, my uncle Toby had that unparalleled modesty of nature I once told you
of, and which, by the bye, stood eternal sentry upon his feelings, that you
might as soon--But where am I going? these reflections crowd in upon me ten
pages at least too soon, and take up that time, which I ought to bestow
upon facts.
Chapter 3.LXXIII.
Of the few legitimate sons of Adam whose breasts never felt what the sting
of love was,--(maintaining first, all mysogynists to be bastards,)--the
greatest heroes of ancient and modern story have carried off amongst them
nine parts in ten of the honour; and I wish for their sakes I had the key
of my study, out of my draw-well, only for five minutes, to tell you their
names--recollect them I cannot--so be content to accept of these, for the
present, in their stead.
There was the great king Aldrovandus, and Bosphorus, and Cappadocius, and
Dardanus, and Pontus, and Asius,--to say nothing of the iron-hearted
Charles the XIIth, whom the Countess of K..... herself could make nothing
of.--There was Babylonicus, and Mediterraneus, and Polixenes, and Persicus,
and Prusicus, not one of whom (except Cappadocius and Pontus, who were both
a little suspected) ever once bowed down his breast to the goddess--The
truth is, they had all of them something else to do--and so had my uncle
Toby--till Fate--till Fate I say, envying his name the glory of being
handed down to posterity with Aldrovandus's and the rest,--she basely
patched up the peace of Utrecht.
--Believe me, Sirs, 'twas the worst deed she did that year.
Chapter 3.LXXIV.
Amongst the many ill consequences of the treaty of Utrecht, it was within a
point of giving my uncle Toby a surfeit of sieges; and though he recovered
his appetite afterwards, yet Calais itself left not a deeper scar in Mary's
heart, than Utrecht upon my uncle Toby's. To the end of his life he never
could hear Utrecht mentioned upon any account whatever,--or so much as read
an article of news extracted out of the Utrecht Gazette, without fetching a
sigh, as if his heart would break in twain.
My father, who was a great Motive-Monger, and consequently a very dangerous
person for a man to sit by, either laughing or crying,--for he generally
knew your motive for doing both, much better than you knew it yourself--
would always console my uncle Toby upon these occasions, in a way, which
shewed plainly, he imagined my uncle Toby grieved for nothing in the whole
affair, so much as the loss of his hobby-horse.--Never mind, brother Toby,
he would say,--by God's blessing we shall have another war break out again
some of these days; and when it does,--the belligerent powers, if they
would hang themselves, cannot keep us out of play.--I defy 'em, my dear
Toby, he would add, to take countries without taking towns,--or towns
without sieges.
My uncle Toby never took this back-stroke of my father's at his hobby-horse
kindly.--He thought the stroke ungenerous; and the more so, because in
striking the horse he hit the rider too, and in the most dishonourable part
a blow could fall; so that upon these occasions, he always laid down his
pipe upon the table with more fire to defend himself than common.
I told the reader, this time two years, that my uncle Toby was not
eloquent; and in the very same page gave an instance to the contrary:--I
repeat the observation, and a fact which contradicts it again.--He was not
eloquent,--it was not easy to my uncle Toby to make long harangues,--and he
hated florid ones; but there were occasions where the stream overflowed the
man, and ran so counter to its usual course, that in some parts my uncle
Toby, for a time, was at least equal to Tertullus--but in others, in my own
opinion, infinitely above him.
My father was so highly pleased with one of these apologetical orations of
my uncle Toby's, which he had delivered one evening before him and Yorick,
that he wrote it down before he went to bed.
I have had the good fortune to meet with it amongst my father's papers,
with here and there an insertion of his own, betwixt two crooks, thus (. .
.), and is endorsed,
My Brother Toby's Justification of His Own Principles and Conduct in
Wishing to Continue the War.
I may safely say, I have read over this apologetical oration of my uncle
Toby's a hundred times, and think it so fine a model of defence,--and shews
so sweet a temperament of gallantry and good principles in him, that I give
it the world, word for word (interlineations and all), as I find it.
Chapter 3.LXXV.
My Uncle Toby's Apologetical Oration.
I am not insensible, brother Shandy, that when a man whose profession is
arms, wishes, as I have done, for war,--it has an ill aspect to the world;-
-and that, how just and right soever his motives the intentions may be,--he
stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from private views in
doing it.
For this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be without
being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter his wish in the
hearing of an enemy; for say what he will, an enemy will not believe him.--
He will be cautious of doing it even to a friend,--lest he may suffer in
his esteem:--But if his heart is overcharged, and a secret sigh for arms
must have its vent, he will reserve it for the ear of a brother, who knows
his character to the bottom, and what his true notions, dispositions, and
principles of honour are: What, I hope, I have been in all these, brother
Shandy, would be unbecoming in me to say:--much worse, I know, have I been
than I ought,--and something worse, perhaps, than I think: But such as I
am, you, my dear brother Shandy, who have sucked the same breasts with me,-
-and with whom I have been brought up from my cradle,--and from whose
knowledge, from the first hours of our boyish pastimes, down to this, I
have concealed no one action of my life, and scarce a thought in it--Such
as I am, brother, you must by this time know me, with all my vices, and
with all my weaknesses too, whether of my age, my temper, my passions, or
my understanding.
Tell me then, my dear brother Shandy, upon which of them it is, that when I
condemned the peace of Utrecht, and grieved the war was not carried on with
vigour a little longer, you should think your brother did it upon unworthy
views; or that in wishing for war, he should be bad enough to wish more of
his fellow-creatures slain,--more slaves made, and more families driven
from their peaceful habitations, merely for his own pleasure:--Tell me,
brother Shandy, upon what one deed of mine do you ground it? (The devil a
deed do I know of, dear Toby, but one for a hundred pounds, which I lent
thee to carry on these cursed sieges.)
If, when I was a school-boy, I could not hear a drum beat, but my heart
beat with it--was it my fault?--Did I plant the propensity there?--Did I
sound the alarm within, or Nature?
When Guy, Earl of Warwick, and Parismus and Parismenus, and Valentine and
Orson, and the Seven Champions of England, were handed around the school,--
were they not all purchased with my own pocket-money? Was that selfish,
brother Shandy? When we read over the siege of Troy, which lasted ten
years and eight months,--though with such a train of artillery as we had at
Namur, the town might have been carried in a week--was I not as much
concerned for the destruction of the Greeks and Trojans as any boy of the
whole school? Had I not three strokes of a ferula given me, two on my
right hand, and one on my left, for calling Helena a bitch for it? Did any
one of you shed more tears for Hector? And when king Priam came to the
camp to beg his body, and returned weeping back to Troy without it,--you
know, brother, I could not eat my dinner.--
--Did that bespeak me cruel? Or because, brother Shandy, my blood flew out
into the camp, and my heart panted for war,--was it a proof it could not
ache for the distresses of war too?
O brother! 'tis one thing for a soldier to gather laurels,--and 'tis
another to scatter cypress.--(Who told thee, my dear Toby, that cypress was
used by the antients on mournful occasions?)
--'Tis one thing, brother Shandy, for a soldier to hazard his own life--to
leap first down into the trench, where he is sure to be cut in pieces:--
'Tis one thing, from public spirit and a thirst of glory, to enter the
breach the first man,--to stand in the foremost rank, and march bravely on
with drums and trumpets, and colours flying about his ears:--'Tis one
thing, I say, brother Shandy, to do this,--and 'tis another thing to
reflect on the miseries of war;--to view the desolations of whole
countries, and consider the intolerable fatigues and hardships which the
soldier himself, the instrument who works them, is forced (for sixpence a
day, if he can get it) to undergo.
Need I be told, dear Yorick, as I was by you, in Le Fever's funeral sermon,
That so soft and gentle a creature, born to love, to mercy, and kindness,
as man is, was not shaped for this?--But why did you not add, Yorick,--if
not by Nature--that he is so by Necessity?--For what is war? what is it,
Yorick, when fought as ours has been, upon principles of liberty, and upon
principles of honour--what is it, but the getting together of quiet and
harmless people, with their swords in their hands, to keep the ambitious
and the turbulent within bounds? And heaven is my witness, brother Shandy,
that the pleasure I have taken in these things,--and that infinite delight,
in particular, which has attended my sieges in my bowling-green, has arose
within me, and I hope in the corporal too, from the consciousness we both
had, that in carrying them on, we were answering the great ends of our
creation.
Chapter 3.LXXVI.
I told the Christian reader--I say Christian--hoping he is one--and if he
is not, I am sorry for it--and only beg he will consider the matter with
himself, and not lay the blame entirely upon this book--
I told him, Sir--for in good truth, when a man is telling a story in the
strange way I do mine, he is obliged continually to be going backwards and
forwards to keep all tight together in the reader's fancy--which, for my
own part, if I did not take heed to do more than at first, there is so much
unfixed and equivocal matter starting up, with so many breaks and gaps in
it,--and so little service do the stars afford, which, nevertheless, I hang
up in some of the darkest passages, knowing that the world is apt to lose
its way, with all the lights the sun itself at noon-day can give it--and
now you see, I am lost myself!--
--But 'tis my father's fault; and whenever my brains come to be dissected,
you will perceive, without spectacles, that he has left a large uneven
thread, as you sometimes see in an unsaleable piece of cambrick, running
along the whole length of the web, and so untowardly, you cannot so much as
cut out a. . ., (here I hang up a couple of lights again)--or a fillet, or
a thumb-stall, but it is seen or felt.--
Quanto id diligentias in liberis procreandis cavendum, sayeth Cardan. All
which being considered, and that you see 'tis morally impracticable for me
to wind this round to where I set out--
I begin the chapter over again.
Chapter 3.LXXVII.
I told the Christian reader in the beginning of the chapter which preceded
my uncle Toby's apologetical oration,--though in a different trope from
what I should make use of now, That the peace of Utrecht was within an ace
of creating the same shyness betwixt my uncle Toby and his hobby-horse, as
it did betwixt the queen and the rest of the confederating powers.
There is an indignant way in which a man sometimes dismounts his horse,
which, as good as says to him, 'I'll go afoot, Sir, all the days of my life
before I would ride a single mile upon your back again.' Now my uncle Toby
could not be said to dismount his horse in this manner; for in strictness
of language, he could not be said to dismount his horse at all--his horse
rather flung him--and somewhat viciously, which made my uncle Toby take it
ten times more unkindly. Let this matter be settled by state-jockies as
they like.--It created, I say, a sort of shyness betwixt my uncle Toby and
his hobby-horse.--He had no occasion for him from the month of March to
November, which was the summer after the articles were signed, except it
was now and then to take a short ride out, just to see that the
fortifications and harbour of Dunkirk were demolished, according to
stipulation.
The French were so backwards all that summer in setting about that affair,
and Monsieur Tugghe, the deputy from the magistrates of Dunkirk, presented
so many affecting petitions to the queen,--beseeching her majesty to cause
only her thunderbolts to fall upon the martial works, which might have
incurred her displeasure,--but to spare--to spare the mole, for the mole's
sake; which, in its naked situation, could be no more than an object of
pity--and the queen (who was but a woman) being of a pitiful disposition,--
and her ministers also, they not wishing in their hearts to have the town
dismantled, for these private reasons,. . .--. . .; so that the whole went
heavily on with my uncle Toby; insomuch, that it was not within three full
months, after he and the corporal had constructed the town, and put it in a
condition to be destroyed, that the several commandants, commissaries,
deputies, negociators, and intendants, would permit him to set about it.--
Fatal interval of inactivity!
The corporal was for beginning the demolition, by making a breach in the
ramparts, or main fortifications of the town--No,--that will never do,
corporal, said my uncle Toby, for in going that way to work with the town,
the English garrison will not be safe in it an hour; because if the French
are treacherous--They are as treacherous as devils, an' please your honour,
said the corporal--It gives me concern always when I hear it, Trim, said my
uncle Toby;--for they don't want personal bravery; and if a breach is made
in the ramparts, they may enter it, and make themselves masters of the
place when they please:--Let them enter it, said the corporal, lifting up
his pioneer's spade in both his hands, as if he was going to lay about him
with it,--let them enter, an' please your honour, if they dare.--In cases
like this, corporal, said my uncle Toby, slipping his right hand down to
the middle of his cane, and holding it afterwards truncheon-wise with his
fore-finger extended,--'tis no part of the consideration of a commandant,
what the enemy dare,--or what they dare not do; he must act with prudence. 
We will begin with the outworks both towards the sea and the land, and
particularly with fort Louis, the most distant of them all, and demolish it
first,--and the rest, one by one, both on our right and left, as we retreat
towards the town;--then we'll demolish the mole,--next fill up the
harbour,--then retire into the citadel, and blow it up into the air: and
having done that, corporal, we'll embark for England.--We are there, quoth
the corporal, recollecting himself--Very true, said my uncle Toby--looking
at the church.
Chapter 3.LXXVIII.
A delusive, delicious consultation or two of this kind, betwixt my uncle
Toby and Trim, upon the demolition of Dunkirk,--for a moment rallied back
the ideas of those pleasures, which were slipping from under him:--still--
still all went on heavily--the magic left the mind the weaker--Stillness,
with Silence at her back, entered the solitary parlour, and drew their
gauzy mantle over my uncle Toby's head;--and Listlessness, with her lax
fibre and undirected eye, sat quietly down beside him in his arm-chair.--No
longer Amberg and Rhinberg, and Limbourg, and Huy, and Bonn, in one year,--
and the prospect of Landen, and Trerebach, and Drusen, and Dendermond, the
next,--hurried on the blood:--No longer did saps, and mines, and blinds,
and gabions, and palisadoes, keep out this fair enemy of man's repose:--No
more could my uncle Toby, after passing the French lines, as he eat his egg
at supper, from thence break into the heart of France,--cross over the
Oyes, and with all Picardie open behind him, march up to the gates of
Paris, and fall asleep with nothing but ideas of glory:--No more was he to
dream, he had fixed the royal standard upon the tower of the Bastile, and
awake with it streaming in his head.
--Softer visions,--gentler vibrations stole sweetly in upon his slumbers;--
the trumpet of war fell out of his hands,--he took up the lute, sweet
instrument! of all others the most delicate! the most difficult!--how wilt
thou touch it, my dear uncle Toby?
Chapter 3.LXXIX.
Now, because I have once or twice said, in my inconsiderate way of talking,
That I was confident the following memoirs of my uncle Toby's courtship of
widow Wadman, whenever I got time to write them, would turn out one of the
most complete systems, both of the elementary and practical part of love
and love-making, that ever was addressed to the world--are you to imagine
from thence, that I shall set out with a description of what love is?
whether part God and part Devil, as Plotinus will have it--
--Or by a more critical equation, and supposing the whole of love to be as
ten--to determine with Ficinus, 'How many parts of it--the one,--and how
many the other;'--or whether it is all of it one great Devil, from head to
tail, as Plato has taken upon him to pronounce; concerning which conceit of
his, I shall not offer my opinion:--but my opinion of Plato is this; that
he appears, from this instance, to have been a man of much the same temper
and way of reasoning with doctor Baynyard, who being a great enemy to
blisters, as imagining that half a dozen of 'em at once, would draw a man
as surely to his grave, as a herse and six--rashly concluded, that the
Devil himself was nothing in the world, but one great bouncing
Cantharidis.--
I have nothing to say to people who allow themselves this monstrous liberty
in arguing, but what Nazianzen cried out (that is, polemically) to
Philagrius--
'(Greek)!' O rare! 'tis fine reasoning, Sir indeed!--'(Greek)' and most
nobly do you aim at truth, when you philosophize about it in your moods and
passions.
Nor is it to be imagined, for the same reason, I should stop to inquire,
whether love is a disease,--or embroil myself with Rhasis and Dioscorides,
whether the seat of it is in the brain or liver;--because this would lead
me on, to an examination of the two very opposite manners, in which
patients have been treated--the one, of Aoetius, who always begun with a
cooling clyster of hempseed and bruised cucumbers;--and followed on with
thin potations of water-lilies and purslane--to which he added a pinch of
snuff, of the herb Hanea;--and where Aoetius durst venture it,--his topaz-
ring.
--The other, that of Gordonius, who (in his cap. 15. de Amore) directs they
should be thrashed, 'ad putorem usque,'--till they stink again.
These are disquisitions which my father, who had laid in a great stock of
knowledge of this kind, will be very busy with in the progress of my uncle
Toby's affairs: I must anticipate thus much, That from his theories of
love, (with which, by the way, he contrived to crucify my uncle Toby's
mind, almost as much as his amours themselves,)--he took a single step into
practice;--and by means of a camphorated cerecloth, which he found means to
impose upon the taylor for buckram, whilst he was making my uncle Toby a
new pair of breeches, he produced Gordonius's effect upon my uncle Toby
without the disgrace.
What changes this produced, will be read in its proper place: all that is
needful to be added to the anecdote, is this--That whatever effect it had
upon my uncle Toby,--it had a vile effect upon the house;--and if my uncle
Toby had not smoaked it down as he did, it might have had a vile effect
upon my father too.
Chapter 3.LXXX.
--'Twill come out of itself by and bye.--All I contend for is, that I am
not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is; and so long as I
can go on with my story intelligibly, with the help of the word itself,
without any other idea to it, than what I have in common with the rest of
the world, why should I differ from it a moment before the time?--When I
can get on no further,--and find myself entangled on all sides of this
mystic labyrinth,--my Opinion will then come in, in course,--and lead me
out.
At present, I hope I shall be sufficiently understood, in telling the
reader, my uncle Toby fell in love:
--Not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a man is fallen in
love,--or that he is deeply in love,--or up to the ears in love,--and
sometimes even over head and ears in it,--carries an idiomatical kind of
implication, that love is a thing below a man:--this is recurring again to
Plato's opinion, which, with all his divinityship,--I hold to be damnable
and heretical:--and so much for that.
Let love therefore be what it will,--my uncle Toby fell into it.
--And possibly, gentle reader, with such a temptation--so wouldst thou: 
For never did thy eyes behold, or thy concupiscence covet any thing in this
world, more concupiscible than widow Wadman.
Chapter 3.LXXXI.
To conceive this right,--call for pen and ink--here's paper ready to your
hand.--Sit down, Sir, paint her to your own mind--as like your mistress as
you can--as unlike your wife as your conscience will let you--'tis all one
to me--please but your own fancy in it.
(blank page)
--Was ever any thing in Nature so sweet!--so exquisite!
--Then, dear Sir, how could my uncle Toby resist it?
Thrice happy book! thou wilt have one page, at least, within thy covers,
which Malice will not blacken, and which Ignorance cannot misrepresent.
Chapter 3.LXXXII.
As Susannah was informed by an express from Mrs. Bridget, of my uncle
Toby's falling in love with her mistress fifteen days before it happened,--
the contents of which express, Susannah communicated to my mother the next
day,--it has just given me an opportunity of entering upon my uncle Toby's
amours a fortnight before their existence.
I have an article of news to tell you, Mr. Shandy, quoth my mother, which
will surprise you greatly.--
Now my father was then holding one of his second beds of justice, and was
musing within himself about the hardships of matrimony, as my mother broke
silence.--
'--My brother Toby,' quoth she, 'is going to be married to Mrs. Wadman.'
--Then he will never, quoth my father, be able to lie diagonally in his bed
again as long as he lives.
It was a consuming vexation to my father, that my mother never asked the
meaning of a thing she did not understand.
--That she is not a woman of science, my father would say--is her
misfortune--but she might ask a question.--
My mother never did.--In short, she went out of the world at last without
knowing whether it turned round, or stood still.--My father had officiously
told her above a thousand times which way it was,--but she always forgot.
For these reasons, a discourse seldom went on much further betwixt them,
than a proposition,--a reply, and a rejoinder; at the end of which, it
generally took breath for a few minutes (as in the affair of the breeches),
and then went on again.
If he marries, 'twill be the worse for us,--quoth my mother.
Not a cherry-stone, said my father,--he may as well batter away his means
upon that, as any thing else,
--To be sure, said my mother: so here ended the proposition--the reply,--
and the rejoinder, I told you of.
It will be some amusement to him, too,--said my father.
A very great one, answered my mother, if he should have children.--
--Lord have mercy upon me,--said my father to himself--. . ..
Chapter 3.LXXXIII.
I am now beginning to get fairly into my work; and by the help of a
vegetable diet, with a few of the cold seeds, I make no doubt but I shall
be able to go on with my uncle Toby's story, and my own, in a tolerable
straight line. Now,
(four very squiggly lines across the page signed Inv.T.S and Scw.T.S)
These were the four lines I moved in through my first, second, third, and
fourth volumes (Alluding to the first edition.)--In the fifth volume I have
been very good,--the precise line I have described in it being this:
(one very squiggly line across the page with loops marked A,B,C,C,C,C,C,D)
By which it appears, that except at the curve, marked A. where I took a
trip to Navarre,--and the indented curve B. which is the short airing when
I was there with the Lady Baussiere and her page,--I have not taken the
least frisk of a digression, till John de la Casse's devils led me the
round you see marked D.--for as for C C C C C they are nothing but
parentheses, and the common ins and outs incident to the lives of the
greatest ministers of state; and when compared with what men have done,--or
with my own transgressions at the letters ABD--they vanish into nothing.
In this last volume I have done better still--for from the end of Le
Fever's episode, to the beginning of my uncle Toby's campaigns,--I have
scarce stepped a yard out of my way.
If I mend at this rate, it is not impossible--by the good leave of his
grace of Benevento's devils--but I may arrive hereafter at the excellency
of going on even thus:
(straight line across the page)
which is a line drawn as straight as I could draw it, by a writing-master's
ruler (borrowed for that purpose), turning neither to the right hand or to
the left.
This right line,--the path-way for Christians to walk in! say divines--
--The emblem of moral rectitude! says Cicero--
--The best line! say cabbage planters--is the shortest line, says
Archimedes, which can be drawn from one given point to another.--
I wish your ladyships would lay this matter to heart, in your next birth-
day suits!
--What a journey!
Pray can you tell me,--that is, without anger, before I write my chapter
upon straight lines--by what mistake--who told them so--or how it has come
to pass, that your men of wit and genius have all along confounded this
line, with the line of Gravitation?
Chapter 3.LXXXIV.
No--I think, I said, I would write two volumes every year, provided the
vile cough which then tormented me, and which to this hour I dread worse
than the devil, would but give me leave--and in another place--(but where,
I can't recollect now) speaking of my book as a machine, and laying my pen
and ruler down cross-wise upon the table, in order to gain the greater
credit to it--I swore it should be kept a going at that rate these forty
years, if it pleased but the fountain of life to bless me so long with
health and good spirits.
Now as for my spirits, little have I to lay to their charge--nay so very
little (unless the mounting me upon a long stick and playing the fool with
me nineteen hours out of the twenty-four, be accusations) that on the
contrary, I have much--much to thank 'em for: cheerily have ye made me
tread the path of life with all the burthens of it (except its cares) upon
my back; in no one moment of my existence, that I remember, have ye once
deserted me, or tinged the objects which came in my way, either with sable,
or with a sickly green; in dangers ye gilded my horizon with hope, and when
Death himself knocked at my door--ye bad him come again; and in so gay a
tone of careless indifference, did ye do it, that he doubted of his
commission--
'--There must certainly be some mistake in this matter,' quoth he.
Now there is nothing in this world I abominate worse, than to be
interrupted in a story--and I was that moment telling Eugenius a most
tawdry one in my way, of a nun who fancied herself a shell-fish, and of a
monk damn'd for eating a muscle, and was shewing him the grounds and
justice of the procedure--
'--Did ever so grave a personage get into so vile a scrape?' quoth Death. 
Thou hast had a narrow escape, Tristram, said Eugenius, taking hold of my
hand as I finished my story--
But there is no living, Eugenius, replied I, at this rate; for as this son
of a whore has found out my lodgings--
--You call him rightly, said Eugenius,--for by sin, we are told, he enter'd
the world--I care not which way he enter'd, quoth I, provided he be not in
such a hurry to take me out with him--for I have forty volumes to write,
and forty thousand things to say and do which no body in the world will say
and do for me, except thyself; and as thou seest he has got me by the
throat (for Eugenius could scarce hear me speak across the table), and that
I am no match for him in the open field, had I not better, whilst these few
scatter'd spirits remain, and these two spider legs of mine (holding one of
them up to him) are able to support me--had I not better, Eugenius, fly for
my life? 'Tis my advice, my dear Tristram, said Eugenius--Then by heaven!
I will lead him a dance he little thinks of--for I will gallop, quoth I,
without looking once behind me, to the banks of the Garonne; and if I hear
him clattering at my heels--I'll scamper away to mount Vesuvius--from
thence to Joppa, and from Joppa to the world's end; where, if he follows
me, I pray God he may break his neck--
--He runs more risk there, said Eugenius, than thou.
Eugenius's wit and affection brought blood into the cheek from whence it
had been some months banish'd--'twas a vile moment to bid adieu in; he led
me to my chaise--Allons! said I; the post-boy gave a crack with his whip--
off I went like a cannon, and in half a dozen bounds got into Dover.
Chapter 3.LXXXV.
Now hang it! quoth I, as I look'd towards the French coast--a man should
know something of his own country too, before he goes abroad--and I never
gave a peep into Rochester church, or took notice of the dock of Chatham,
or visited St. Thomas at Canterbury, though they all three laid in my way--
--But mine, indeed, is a particular case--
So without arguing the matter further with Thomas o'Becket, or any one
else--I skip'd into the boat, and in five minutes we got under sail, and
scudded away like the wind.
Pray, captain, quoth I, as I was going down into the cabin, is a man never
overtaken by Death in this passage?
Why, there is not time for a man to be sick in it, replied he--What a
cursed lyar! for I am sick as a horse, quoth I, already--what a brain!--
upside down!--hey-day! the cells are broke loose one into another, and the
blood, and the lymph, and the nervous juices, with the fix'd and volatile
salts, are all jumbled into one mass--good G..! every thing turns round in
it like a thousand whirlpools--I'd give a shilling to know if I shan't
write the clearer for it--
Sick! sick! sick! sick!--
--When shall we get to land? captain--they have hearts like stones--O I am
deadly sick!--reach me that thing, boy--'tis the most discomfiting
sickness--I wish I was at the bottom--Madam! how is it with you? Undone!
undone! un. . .--O! undone! sir--What the first time?--No, 'tis the second,
third, sixth, tenth time, sir,--hey-day!--what a trampling over head!--
hollo! cabin boy! what's the matter?
The wind chopp'd about! s'Death--then I shall meet him full in the face.
What luck!--'tis chopp'd about again, master--O the devil chop it--
Captain, quoth she, for heaven's sake, let us get ashore.
Chapter 3.LXXXVI.
It is a great inconvenience to a man in a haste, that there are three
distinct roads between Calais and Paris, in behalf of which there is so
much to be said by the several deputies from the towns which lie along
them, that half a day is easily lost in settling which you'll take.
First, the road by Lisle and Arras, which is the most about--but most
interesting, and instructing.
The second, that by Amiens, which you may go, if you would see Chantilly--
And that by Beauvais, which you may go, if you will.
For this reason a great many chuse to go by Beauvais.
Chapter 3.LXXXVII.
'Now before I quit Calais,' a travel-writer would say, 'it would not be
amiss to give some account of it.'--Now I think it very much amiss--that a
man cannot go quietly through a town and let it alone, when it does not
meddle with him, but that he must be turning about and drawing his pen at
every kennel he crosses over, merely o' my conscience for the sake of
drawing it; because, if we may judge from what has been wrote of these
things, by all who have wrote and gallop'd--or who have gallop'd and wrote,
which is a different way still; or who, for more expedition than the rest,
have wrote galloping, which is the way I do at present--from the great
Addison, who did it with his satchel of school books hanging at his a. . .,
and galling his beast's crupper at every stroke--there is not a gallopper
of us all who might not have gone on ambling quietly in his own ground (in
case he had any), and have wrote all he had to write, dry-shod, as well as
not.
For my own part, as heaven is my judge, and to which I shall ever make my
last appeal--I know no more of Calais (except the little my barber told me
of it as he was whetting his razor) than I do this moment of Grand Cairo;
for it was dusky in the evening when I landed, and dark as pitch in the
morning when I set out, and yet by merely knowing what is what, and by
drawing this from that in one part of the town, and by spelling and putting
this and that together in another--I would lay any travelling odds, that I
this moment write a chapter upon Calais as long as my arm; and with so
distinct and satisfactory a detail of every item, which is worth a
stranger's curiosity in the town--that you would take me for the town-clerk
of Calais itself--and where, sir, would be the wonder? was not Democritus,
who laughed ten times more than I--town-clerk of Abdera? and was not (I
forget his name) who had more discretion than us both, town-clerk of
Ephesus?--it should be penn'd moreover, sir, with so much knowledge and
good sense, and truth, and precision--
--Nay--if you don't believe me, you may read the chapter for your pains.
Chapter 3.LXXXVIII.
Calais, Calatium, Calusium, Calesium.
This town, if we may trust its archives, the authority of which I see no
reason to call in question in this place--was once no more than a small
village belonging to one of the first Counts de Guignes; and as it boasts
at present of no less than fourteen thousand inhabitants, exclusive of four
hundred and twenty distinct families in the basse ville, or suburbs--it
must have grown up by little and little, I suppose, to its present size.
Though there are four convents, there is but one parochial church in the
whole town; I had not an opportunity of taking its exact dimensions, but it
is pretty easy to make a tolerable conjecture of 'em--for as there are
fourteen thousand inhabitants in the town, if the church holds them all it
must be considerably large--and if it will not--'tis a very great pity they
have not another--it is built in form of a cross, and dedicated to the
Virgin Mary; the steeple, which has a spire to it, is placed in the middle
of the church, and stands upon four pillars elegant and light enough, but
sufficiently strong at the same time--it is decorated with eleven altars,
most of which are rather fine than beautiful. The great altar is a master-
piece in its kind; 'tis of white marble, and, as I was told, near sixty
feet high--had it been much higher, it had been as high as mount Calvary
itself--therefore, I suppose it must be high enough in all conscience.
There was nothing struck me more than the great Square; tho' I cannot say
'tis either well paved or well built; but 'tis in the heart of the town,
and most of the streets, especially those in that quarter, all terminate in
it; could there have been a fountain in all Calais, which it seems there
cannot, as such an object would have been a great ornament, it is not to be
doubted, but that the inhabitants would have had it in the very centre of
this square,--not that it is properly a square,--because 'tis forty feet
longer from east to west, than from north to south; so that the French in
general have more reason on their side in calling them Places than Squares,
which, strictly speaking, to be sure, they are not.
The town-house seems to be but a sorry building, and not to be kept in the
best repair; otherwise it had been a second great ornament to this place;
it answers however its destination, and serves very well for the reception
of the magistrates, who assemble in it from time to time; so that 'tis
presumable, justice is regularly distributed.
I have heard much of it, but there is nothing at all curious in the
Courgain; 'tis a distinct quarter of the town, inhabited solely by sailors
and fishermen; it consists of a number of small streets, neatly built and
mostly of brick; 'tis extremely populous, but as that may be accounted for,
from the principles of their diet,--there is nothing curious in that
neither.--A traveller may see it to satisfy himself--he must not omit
however taking notice of La Tour de Guet, upon any account; 'tis so called
from its particular destination, because in war it serves to discover and
give notice of the enemies which approach the place, either by sea or
land;--but 'tis monstrous high, and catches the eye so continually, you
cannot avoid taking notice of it if you would.
It was a singular disappointment to me, that I could not have permission to
take an exact survey of the fortifications, which are the strongest in the
world, and which, from first to last, that is, for the time they were set
about by Philip of France, Count of Bologne, to the present war, wherein
many reparations were made, have cost (as I learned afterwards from an
engineer in Gascony)--above a hundred millions of livres. It is very
remarkable, that at the Tete de Gravelenes, and where the town is naturally
the weakest, they have expended the most money; so that the outworks
stretch a great way into the campaign, and consequently occupy a large
tract of ground--However, after all that is said and done, it must be
acknowledged that Calais was never upon any account so considerable from
itself, as from its situation, and that easy entrance which it gave our
ancestors, upon all occasions, into France: it was not without its
inconveniences also; being no less troublesome to the English in those
times, than Dunkirk has been to us, in ours; so that it was deservedly
looked upon as the key to both kingdoms, which no doubt is the reason that
there have arisen so many contentions who should keep it: of these, the
siege of Calais, or rather the blockade (for it was shut up both by land
and sea), was the most memorable, as it with-stood the efforts of Edward
the Third a whole year, and was not terminated at last but by famine and
extreme misery; the gallantry of Eustace de St. Pierre, who first offered
himself a victim for his fellow-citizens, has rank'd his name with heroes. 
As it will not take up above fifty pages, it would be injustice to the
reader, not to give him a minute account of that romantic transaction, as
well as of the siege itself, in Rapin's own words:
Chapter 3.LXXXIX.
--But courage! gentle reader!--I scorn it--'tis enough to have thee in my
power--but to make use of the advantage which the fortune of the pen has
now gained over thee, would be too much--No--! by that all-powerful fire
which warms the visionary brain, and lights the spirits through unworldly
tracts! ere I would force a helpless creature upon this hard service, and
make thee pay, poor soul! for fifty pages, which I have no right to sell
thee,--naked as I am, I would browse upon the mountains, and smile that the
north wind brought me neither my tent or my supper.
--So put on, my brave boy! and make the best of thy way to Boulogne.
Chapter 3.XC.
Boulogne!--hah!--so we are all got together--debtors and sinners before
heaven; a jolly set of us--but I can't stay and quaff it off with you--I'm
pursued myself like a hundred devils, and shall be overtaken, before I can
well change horses:--for heaven's sake, make haste--'Tis for high-treason,
quoth a very little man, whispering as low as he could to a very tall man,
that stood next him--Or else for murder; quoth the tall man--Well thrown,
Size-ace! quoth I. No; quoth a third, the gentleman has been committing--
Ah! ma chere fille! said I, as she tripp'd by from her matins--you look as
rosy as the morning (for the sun was rising, and it made the compliment the
more gracious)--No; it can't be that, quoth a fourth--(she made a curt'sy
to me--I kiss'd my hand) 'tis debt, continued he: 'Tis certainly for debt;
quoth a fifth; I would not pay that gentleman's debts, quoth Ace, for a
thousand pounds; nor would I, quoth Size, for six times the sum--Well
thrown, Size-ace, again! quoth I;--but I have no debt but the debt of
Nature, and I want but patience of her, and I will pay her every farthing I
owe her--How can you be so hard-hearted, Madam, to arrest a poor traveller
going along without molestation to any one upon his lawful occasions? do
stop that death-looking, long-striding scoundrel of a scare-sinner, who is
posting after me--he never would have followed me but for you--if it be but
for a stage or two, just to give me start of him, I beseech you, madam--do,
dear lady--
--Now, in troth, 'tis a great pity, quoth mine Irish host, that all this
good courtship should be lost; for the young gentlewoman has been after
going out of hearing of it all along.--
--Simpleton! quoth I.
--So you have nothing else in Boulogne worth seeing?
--By Jasus! there is the finest Seminary for the Humanities--
--There cannot be a finer; quoth I.
Chapter 3.XCI.
When the precipitancy of a man's wishes hurries on his ideas ninety times
faster than the vehicle he rides in--woe be to truth! and woe be to the
vehicle and its tackling (let 'em be made of what stuff you will) upon
which he breathes forth the disappointment of his soul!
As I never give general characters either of men or things in choler, 'the
most haste the worse speed,' was all the reflection I made upon the affair,
the first time it happen'd;--the second, third, fourth, and fifth time, I
confined it respectively to those times, and accordingly blamed only the
second, third, fourth, and fifth post-boy for it, without carrying my
reflections further; but the event continuing to befal me from the fifth,
to the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth time, and without one
exception, I then could not avoid making a national reflection of it, which
I do in these words;
That something is always wrong in a French post-chaise, upon first setting
out.
Or the proposition may stand thus:
A French postilion has always to alight before he has got three hundred
yards out of town.
What's wrong now?--Diable!--a rope's broke!--a knot has slipt!--a staple's
drawn!--a bolt's to whittle!--a tag, a rag, a jag, a strap, a buckle, or a
buckle's tongue, want altering.
Now true as all this is, I never think myself impowered to excommunicate
thereupon either the post-chaise, or its driver--nor do I take it into my
head to swear by the living G.., I would rather go a-foot ten thousand
times--or that I will be damn'd, if ever I get into another--but I take the
matter coolly before me, and consider, that some tag, or rag, or jag, or
bolt, or buckle, or buckle's tongue, will ever be a wanting or want
altering, travel where I will--so I never chaff, but take the good and the
bad as they fall in my road, and get on:--Do so, my lad! said I; he had
lost five minutes already, in alighting in order to get at a luncheon of
black bread, which he had cramm'd into the chaise-pocket, and was
remounted, and going leisurely on, to relish it the better.--Get on, my
lad, said I, briskly--but in the most persuasive tone imaginable, for I
jingled a four-and-twenty sous piece against the glass, taking care to hold
the flat side towards him, as he look'd back: the dog grinn'd intelligence
from his right ear to his left, and behind his sooty muzzle discovered such
a pearly row of teeth, that Sovereignty would have pawn'd her jewels for
them.
Just heaven! What masticators!--/What bread!--
and so as he finished the last mouthful of it, we entered the town of
Montreuil.
Chapter 3.XCII.
There is not a town in all France which, in my opinion, looks better in the
map, than Montreuil;--I own, it does not look so well in the book of post-
roads; but when you come to see it--to be sure it looks most pitifully.
There is one thing, however, in it at present very handsome; and that is,
the inn-keeper's daughter: She has been eighteen months at Amiens, and six
at Paris, in going through her classes; so knits, and sews, and dances, and
does the little coquetries very well.--
--A slut! in running them over within these five minutes that I have stood
looking at her, she has let fall at least a dozen loops in a white thread
stocking--yes, yes--I see, you cunning gipsy!--'tis long and taper--you
need not pin it to your knee--and that 'tis your own--and fits you
exactly.--
--That Nature should have told this creature a word about a statue's thumb!
--But as this sample is worth all their thumbs--besides, I have her thumbs
and fingers in at the bargain, if they can be any guide to me,--and as
Janatone withal (for that is her name) stands so well for a drawing--may I
never draw more, or rather may I draw like a draught-horse, by main
strength all the days of my life,--if I do not draw her in all her
proportions, and with as determined a pencil, as if I had her in the
wettest drapery.--
--But your worships chuse rather that I give you the length, breadth, and
perpendicular height of the great parish-church, or drawing of the facade
of the abbey of Saint Austreberte which has been transported from Artois
hither--every thing is just I suppose as the masons and carpenters left
them,--and if the belief in Christ continues so long, will be so these
fifty years to come--so your worships and reverences may all measure them
at your leisures--but he who measures thee, Janatone, must do it now--thou
carriest the principles of change within thy frame; and considering the
chances of a transitory life, I would not answer for thee a moment; ere
twice twelve months are passed and gone, thou mayest grow out like a
pumpkin, and lose thy shapes--or thou mayest go off like a flower, and lose
thy beauty--nay, thou mayest go off like a hussy--and lose thyself.--I
would not answer for my aunt Dinah, was she alive--'faith, scarce for her
picture--were it but painted by Reynolds--
But if I go on with my drawing, after naming that son of Apollo, I'll be
shot--
So you must e'en be content with the original; which, if the evening is
fine in passing thro' Montreuil, you will see at your chaise-door, as you
change horses: but unless you have as bad a reason for haste as I have--you
had better stop:--She has a little of the devote: but that, sir, is a
terce to a nine in your favour--
-L... help me! I could not count a single point: so had been piqued and
repiqued, and capotted to the devil.
Chapter 3.XCIII.
All which being considered, and that Death moreover might be much nearer me
than I imagined--I wish I was at Abbeville, quoth I, were it only to see
how they card and spin--so off we set.
(Vid. Book of French post-roads, page 36. edition of 1762.)
de Montreuil a Nampont - poste et demi
de Nampont a Bernay --- poste
de Bernay a Nouvion --- poste
de Nouvion a Abbeville poste
--but the carders and spinners were all gone to bed.
Chapter 3.XCIV.
What a vast advantage is travelling! only it heats one; but there is a
remedy for that, which you may pick out of the next chapter.
Chapter 3.XCV.
Was I in a condition to stipulate with Death, as I am this moment with my
apothecary, how and where I will take his clyster--I should certainly
declare against submitting to it before my friends; and therefore I never
seriously think upon the mode and manner of this great catastrophe, which
generally takes up and torments my thoughts as much as the catastrophe
itself; but I constantly draw the curtain across it with this wish, that
the Disposer of all things may so order it, that it happen not to me in my
own house--but rather in some decent inn--at home, I know it,--the concern
of my friends, and the last services of wiping my brows, and smoothing my
pillow, which the quivering hand of pale affection shall pay me, will so
crucify my soul, that I shall die of a distemper which my physician is not
aware of: but in an inn, the few cold offices I wanted, would be purchased
with a few guineas, and paid me with an undisturbed, but punctual
attention--but mark. This inn should not be the inn at Abbeville--if there
was not another inn in the universe, I would strike that inn out of the
capitulation: so
Let the horses be in the chaise exactly by four in the morning--Yes, by
four, Sir,--or by Genevieve! I'll raise a clatter in the house shall wake
the dead.
Chapter 3.XCVI.
'Make them like unto a wheel,' is a bitter sarcasm, as all the learned
know, against the grand tour, and that restless spirit for making it, which
David prophetically foresaw would haunt the children of men in the latter
days; and therefore, as thinketh the great bishop Hall, 'tis one of the
severest imprecations which David ever utter'd against the enemies of the
Lord--and, as if he had said, 'I wish them no worse luck than always to be
rolling about.'--So much motion, continues he (for he was very corpulent)--
is so much unquietness; and so much of rest, by the same analogy, is so
much of heaven.
Now, I (being very thin) think differently; and that so much of motion, is
so much of life, and so much of joy--and that to stand still, or get on but
slowly, is death and the devil--
Hollo! Ho!--the whole world's asleep!--bring out the horses--grease the
wheels--tie on the mail--and drive a nail into that moulding--I'll not lose
a moment--
Now the wheel we are talking of, and whereinto (but not whereonto, for that
would make an Ixion's wheel of it) he curseth his enemies, according to the
bishop's habit of body, should certainly be a post-chaise wheel, whether
they were set up in Palestine at that time or not--and my wheel, for the
contrary reasons, must as certainly be a cart-wheel groaning round its
revolution once in an age; and of which sort, were I to turn commentator, I
should make no scruple to affirm, they had great store in that hilly
country.
I love the Pythagoreans (much more than ever I dare tell my dear Jenny) for
their '(Greek)'--(their) 'getting out of the body, in order to think well.' 
No man thinks right, whilst he is in it; blinded as he must be, with his
congenial humours, and drawn differently aside, as the bishop and myself
have been, with too lax or too tense a fibre--Reason is, half of it, Sense;
and the measure of heaven itself is but the measure of our present
appetites and concoctions.--
--But which of the two, in the present case, do you think to be mostly in
the wrong?
You, certainly: quoth she, to disturb a whole family so early.
Chapter 3.XCVII.
--But she did not know I was under a vow not to shave my beard till I got
to Paris;--yet I hate to make mysteries of nothing;--'tis the cold
cautiousness of one of those little souls from which Lessius (lib. 13. de
moribus divinis, cap. 24.) hath made his estimate, wherein he setteth
forth, That one Dutch mile, cubically multiplied, will allow room enough,
and to spare, for eight hundred thousand millions, which he supposes to be
as great a number of souls (counting from the fall of Adam) as can possibly
be damn'd to the end of the world.
From what he has made this second estimate--unless from the parental
goodness of God--I don't know--I am much more at a loss what could be in
Franciscus Ribbera's head, who pretends that no less a space than one of
two hundred Italian miles multiplied into itself, will be sufficient to
hold the like number--he certainly must have gone upon some of the old
Roman souls, of which he had read, without reflecting how much, by a
gradual and most tabid decline, in the course of eighteen hundred years,
they must unavoidably have shrunk so as to have come, when he wrote, almost
to nothing.
In Lessius's time, who seems the cooler man, they were as little as can be
imagined--
--We find them less now--
And next winter we shall find them less again; so that if we go on from
little to less, and from less to nothing, I hesitate not one moment to
affirm, that in half a century at this rate, we shall have no souls at all;
which being the period beyond which I doubt likewise of the existence of
the Christian faith, 'twill be one advantage that both of 'em will be
exactly worn out together.
Blessed Jupiter! and blessed every other heathen god and goddess! for now
ye will all come into play again, and with Priapus at your tails--what
jovial times!--but where am I? and into what a delicious riot of things am
I rushing? I--I who must be cut short in the midst of my days, and taste
no more of 'em than what I borrow from my imagination--peace to thee,
generous fool! and let me go on.
Chapter 3.XCVIII.
--'So hating, I say, to make mysteries of nothing'--I intrusted it with the
post-boy, as soon as ever I got off the stones; he gave a crack with his
whip to balance the compliment; and with the thill-horse trotting, and a
sort of an up and a down of the other, we danced it along to Ailly au
clochers, famed in days of yore for the finest chimes in the world; but we
danced through it without music--the chimes being greatly out of order--(as
in truth they were through all France).
And so making all possible speed, from
Ailly au clochers, I got to Hixcourt,
from Hixcourt I got to Pequignay, and
from Pequignay, I got to Amiens,
concerning which town I have nothing to inform you, but what I have
informed you once before--and that was--that Janatone went there to school.
Chapter 3.XCIX.
In the whole catalogue of those whiffling vexations which come puffing
across a man's canvass, there is not one of a more teasing and tormenting
nature, than this particular one which I am going to describe--and for
which (unless you travel with an avance-courier, which numbers do in order
to prevent it)--there is no help: and it is this.
That be you in never so kindly a propensity to sleep--though you are
passing perhaps through the finest country--upon the best roads, and in the
easiest carriage for doing it in the world--nay, was you sure you could
sleep fifty miles straight forwards, without once opening your eyes--nay,
what is more, was you as demonstratively satisfied as you can be of any
truth in Euclid, that you should upon all accounts be full as well asleep
as awake--nay, perhaps better--Yet the incessant returns of paying for the
horses at every stage,--with the necessity thereupon of putting your hand
into your pocket, and counting out from thence three livres fifteen sous
(sous by sous), puts an end to so much of the project, that you cannot
execute above six miles of it (or supposing it is a post and a half, that
is but nine)--were it to save your soul from destruction.
--I'll be even with 'em, quoth I, for I'll put the precise sum into a piece
of paper, and hold it ready in my hand all the way: 'Now I shall have
nothing to do,' said I (composing myself to rest), 'but to drop this gently
into the post-boy's hat, and not say a word.'--Then there wants two sous
more to drink--or there is a twelve sous piece of Louis XIV. which will not
pass--or a livre and some odd liards to be brought over from the last
stage, which Monsieur had forgot; which altercations (as a man cannot
dispute very well asleep) rouse him: still is sweet sleep retrievable; and
still might the flesh weigh down the spirit, and recover itself of these
blows--but then, by heaven! you have paid but for a single post--whereas
'tis a post and a half; and this obliges you to pull out your book of post-
roads, the print of which is so very small, it forces you to open your
eyes, whether you will or no: Then Monsieur le Cure offers you a pinch of
snuff--or a poor soldier shews you his leg--or a shaveling his box--or the
priestesse of the cistern will water your wheels--they do not want it--but
she swears by her priesthood (throwing it back) that they do:--then you
have all these points to argue, or consider over in your mind; in doing of
which, the rational powers get so thoroughly awakened--you may get 'em to
sleep again as you can.
It was entirely owing to one of these misfortunes, or I had pass'd clean by
the stables of Chantilly--
--But the postillion first affirming, and then persisting in it to my face,
that there was no mark upon the two sous piece, I open'd my eyes to be
convinced --and seeing the mark upon it as plain as my nose--I leap'd out
of the chaise in a passion, and so saw every thing at Chantilly in spite.--
I tried it but for three posts and a half, but believe 'tis the best
principle in the world to travel speedily upon; for as few objects look
very inviting in that mood--you have little or nothing to stop you; by
which means it was that I passed through St. Dennis, without turning my
head so much as on one side towards the Abby--
--Richness of their treasury! stuff and nonsense!--bating their jewels,
which are all false, I would not give three sous for any one thing in it,
but Jaidas's lantern--nor for that either, only as it grows dark, it might
be of use.
Chapter 3.C.
Crack, crack--crack, crack--crack, crack--so this is Paris! quoth I
(continuing in the same mood)--and this is Paris!--humph!--Paris! cried I,
repeating the name the third time--
The first, the finest, the most brilliant--
The streets however are nasty.
But it looks, I suppose, better than it smells--crack, crack--crack, crack-
-what a fuss thou makest!--as if it concerned the good people to be
informed, that a man with pale face and clad in black, had the honour to be
driven into Paris at nine o'clock at night, by a postillion in a tawny
yellow jerkin, turned up with red calamanco--crack, crack--crack, crack--
crack, crack,--I wish thy whip--
--But 'tis the spirit of thy nation; so crack--crack on.
Ha!--and no one gives the wall!--but in the School of Urbanity herself, if
the walls are besh..t--how can you do otherwise?
And prithee when do they light the lamps? What?--never in the summer
months!--Ho! 'tis the time of sallads.--O rare! sallad and soup--soup and
sallad--sallad and soup, encore--
--'Tis too much for sinners.
Now I cannot bear the barbarity of it; how can that unconscionable coachman
talk so much bawdy to that lean horse? don't you see, friend, the streets
are so villanously narrow, that there is not room in all Paris to turn a
wheelbarrow? In the grandest city of the whole world, it would not have
been amiss, if they had been left a thought wider; nay, were it only so
much in every single street, as that a man might know (was it only for
satisfaction) on which side of it he was walking.
One--two--three--four--five--six--seven--eight--nine--ten.--Ten cooks
shops! and twice the number of barbers! and all within three minutes
driving! one would think that all the cooks in the world, on some great
merry-meeting with the barbers, by joint consent had said--Come, let us all
go live at Paris: the French love good eating--they are all gourmands--we
shall rank high; if their god is their belly--their cooks must be
gentlemen: and forasmuch as the periwig maketh the man, and the periwig-
maker maketh the periwig--ergo, would the barbers say, we shall rank higher
still--we shall be above you all--we shall be Capitouls (Chief Magistrate
in Toulouse, &c. &c. &c.) at least--pardi! we shall all wear swords--
--And so, one would swear, (that is, by candle-light,--but there is no
depending upon it,) they continued to do, to this day.
Chapter 3.CI.
The French are certainly misunderstood:--but whether the fault is theirs,
in not sufficiently explaining themselves; or speaking with that exact
limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such
importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us--or
whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding
their language always so critically as to know 'what they would be at'--I
shall not decide; but 'tis evident to me, when they affirm, 'That they who
have seen Paris, have seen every thing,' they must mean to speak of those
who have seen it by day-light.
As for candle-light--I give it up--I have said before, there was no
depending upon it--and I repeat it again; but not because the lights and
shades are too sharp--or the tints confounded--or that there is neither
beauty or keeping, &c.. . .for that's not truth--but it is an uncertain
light in this respect, That in all the five hundred grand Hotels, which
they number up to you in Paris--and the five hundred good things, at a
modest computation (for 'tis only allowing one good thing to a Hotel),
which by candle-light are best to be seen, felt, heard, and understood
(which, by the bye, is a quotation from Lilly)--the devil a one of us out
of fifty, can get our heads fairly thrust in amongst them.
This is no part of the French computation: 'tis simply this,
That by the last survey taken in the year one thousand seven hundred and
sixteen, since which time there have been considerable augmentations, Paris
doth contain nine hundred streets; (viz)
In the quarter called the City--there are fifty-three streets.
In St. James of the Shambles, fifty-five streets.
In St. Oportune, thirty-four streets.
In the quarter of the Louvre, twenty-five streets.
In the Palace Royal, or St. Honorius, forty-nine streets.
In Mont. Martyr, forty-one streets.
In St. Eustace, twenty-nine streets.
In the Halles, twenty-seven streets.
In St. Dennis, fifty-five streets.
In St. Martin, fifty-four streets.
In St. Paul, or the Mortellerie, twenty-seven streets.
The Greve, thirty-eight streets.
In St. Avoy, or the Verrerie, nineteen streets.
In the Marais, or the Temple, fifty-two streets.
In St. Antony's, sixty-eight streets.
In the Place Maubert, eighty-one streets.
In St. Bennet, sixty streets.
In St. Andrews de Arcs, fifty-one streets.
In the quarter of the Luxembourg, sixty-two streets.
And in that of St. Germain, fifty-five streets, into any of which you may
walk; and that when you have seen them with all that belongs to them,
fairly by day-light--their gates, their bridges, their squares, their
statues. . .and have crusaded it moreover, through all their parish-
churches, by no means omitting St. Roche and Sulpice. . .and to crown all,
have taken a walk to the four palaces, which you may see, either with or
without the statues and pictures, just as you chuse--
--Then you will have seen--
--but 'tis what no one needeth to tell you, for you will read of it
yourself upon the portico of the Louvre, in these words,
Earth No Such Folks!--No Folks E'er Such A Town
As Paris Is!--Sing, Derry, Derry, Down.
(Non orbis gentem, non urbem gens habet ullam
--ulla parem.)
The French have a gay way of treating every thing that is Great; and that
is all can be said upon it.
Chapter 3.CII.
In mentioning the word gay (as in the close of the last chapter) it puts
one (i.e. an author) in mind of the word spleen--especially if he has any
thing to say upon it: not that by any analysis--or that from any table of
interest or genealogy, there appears much more ground of alliance betwixt
them, than betwixt light and darkness, or any two of the most unfriendly
opposites in nature--only 'tis an undercraft of authors to keep up a good
understanding amongst words, as politicians do amongst men--not knowing how
near they may be under a necessity of placing them to each other--which
point being now gain'd, and that I may place mine exactly to my mind, I
write it down here--
Spleen.
This, upon leaving Chantilly, I declared to be the best principle in the
world to travel speedily upon; but I gave it only as matter of opinion. I
still continue in the same sentiments--only I had not then experience
enough of its working to add this, that though you do get on at a tearing
rate, yet you get on but uneasily to yourself at the same time; for which
reason I here quit it entirely, and for ever, and 'tis heartily at any
one's service--it has spoiled me the digestion of a good supper, and
brought on a bilious diarrhoea, which has brought me back again to my first
principle on which I set out--and with which I shall now scamper it away to
the banks of the Garonne--
--No;--I cannot stop a moment to give you the character of the people--
their genius--their manners--their customs--their laws--their religion--
their government--their manufactures--their commerce--their finances, with
all the resources and hidden springs which sustain them: qualified as I may
be, by spending three days and two nights amongst them, and during all that
time making these things the entire subject of my enquiries and
reflections--
Still--still I must away--the roads are paved--the posts are short--the
days are long--'tis no more than noon--I shall be at Fontainebleau before
the king--

A Dedication to a Great Man.
Having, a priori, intended to dedicate The Amours of my Uncle Toby to Mr.
...--I see more reasons, a posteriori, for doing it to Lord ........
I should lament from my soul, if this exposed me to the jealousy of their
Reverences; because a posteriori, in Court-latin, signifies the kissing
hands for preferment--or any thing else--in order to get it.
My opinion of Lord ....... is neither better nor worse, than it was of Mr.
.... Honours, like impressions upon coin, may give an ideal and local
value to a bit of base metal; but Gold and Silver will pass all the world
over without any other recommendation than their own weight.
The same good-will that made me think of offering up half an hour's
amusement to Mr. ... when out of place--operates more forcibly at present,
as half an hour's amusement will be more serviceable and refreshing after
labour and sorrow, than after a philosophical repast.
Nothing is so perfectly amusement as a total change of ideas; no ideas are
so totally different as those of Ministers, and innocent Lovers: for which
reason, when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and set such marks
upon them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning them for the
future--I propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd,
Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray,
Far as the Statesman's walk or Patriot-way;
Yet simple Nature to his hopes had given
Out of a cloud-capp'd head a humbler heaven;
Some untam'd World in depths of wood embraced--
Some happier Island in the wat'ry-waste--
And where admitted to that equal sky,
His faithful Dogs should bear him company.
In a word, by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his
Imagination, I shall unavoidably give a Diversion to his passionate and
love-sick Contemplations. In the mean time,

The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gent.
Chapter 4.I.
Now I hate to hear a person, especially if he be a traveller, complain that
we do not get on so fast in France as we do in England; whereas we get on
much faster, consideratis considerandis; thereby always meaning, that if
you weigh their vehicles with the mountains of baggage which you lay both
before and behind upon them--and then consider their puny horses, with the
very little they give them--'tis a wonder they get on at all: their
suffering is most unchristian, and 'tis evident thereupon to me, that a
French post-horse would not know what in the world to do, was it not for
the two words ...... and ...... in which there is as much sustenance, as if
you give him a peck of corn: now as these words cost nothing, I long from
my soul to tell the reader what they are; but here is the question--they
must be told him plainly, and with the most distinct articulation, or it
will answer no end--and yet to do it in that plain way--though their
reverences may laugh at it in the bed-chamber--full well I wot, they will
abuse it in the parlour: for which cause, I have been volving and
revolving in my fancy some time, but to no purpose, by what clean device or
facette contrivance I might so modulate them, that whilst I satisfy that
ear which the reader chuses to lend me--I might not dissatisfy the other
which he keeps to himself.
--My ink burns my finger to try--and when I have--'twill have a worse
consequence--It will burn (I fear) my paper.
--No;--I dare not--
But if you wish to know how the abbess of Andouillets and a novice of her
convent got over the difficulty (only first wishing myself all imaginable
success)--I'll tell you without the least scruple.
Chapter 4.II.
The abbess of Andouillets, which if you look into the large set of
provincial maps now publishing at Paris, you will find situated amongst the
hills which divide Burgundy from Savoy, being in danger of an Anchylosis or
stiff joint (the sinovia of her knee becoming hard by long matins), and
having tried every remedy--first, prayers and thanksgiving; then
invocations to all the saints in heaven promiscuously--then particularly to
every saint who had ever had a stiff leg before her--then touching it with
all the reliques of the convent, principally with the thigh-bone of the man
of Lystra, who had been impotent from his youth--then wrapping it up in her
veil when she went to bed--then cross-wise her rosary--then bringing in to
her aid the secular arm, and anointing it with oils and hot fat of animals-
-then treating it with emollient and resolving fomentations--then with
poultices of marsh-mallows, mallows, bonus Henricus, white lillies and
fenugreek--then taking the woods, I mean the smoak of 'em, holding her
scapulary across her lap--then decoctions of wild chicory, water-cresses,
chervil, sweet cecily and cochlearia--and nothing all this while answering,
was prevailed on at last to try the hot-baths of Bourbon--so having first
obtained leave of the visitor-general to take care of her existence--she
ordered all to be got ready for her journey: a novice of the convent of
about seventeen, who had been troubled with a whitloe in her middle finger,
by sticking it constantly into the abbess's cast poultices, &c.--had gained
such an interest, that overlooking a sciatical old nun, who might have been
set up for ever by the hot-baths of Bourbon, Margarita, the little novice,
was elected as the companion of the journey.
An old calesh, belonging to the abbesse, lined with green frize, was
ordered to be drawn out into the sun--the gardener of the convent being
chosen muleteer, led out the two old mules, to clip the hair from the rump-
ends of their tails, whilst a couple of lay-sisters were busied, the one in
darning the lining, and the other in sewing on the shreds of yellow
binding, which the teeth of time had unravelled--the under-gardener dress'd
the muleteer's hat in hot wine-lees--and a taylor sat musically at it, in a
shed over-against the convent, in assorting four dozen of bells for the
harness, whistling to each bell, as he tied it on with a thong.--
--The carpenter and the smith of Andouillets held a council of wheels; and
by seven, the morning after, all look'd spruce, and was ready at the gate
of the convent for the hot-baths of Bourbon--two rows of the unfortunate
stood ready there an hour before.
The abbess of Andouillets, supported by Margarita the novice, advanced
slowly to the calesh, both clad in white, with their black rosaries hanging
at their breasts--
--There was a simple solemnity in the contrast: they entered the calesh;
the nuns in the same uniform, sweet emblem of innocence, each occupied a
window, and as the abbess and Margarita look'd up--each (the sciatical poor
nun excepted)--each stream'd out the end of her veil in the air--then
kiss'd the lilly hand which let it go: the good abbess and Margarita laid
their hands saint-wise upon their breasts--look'd up to heaven--then to
them--and look'd 'God bless you, dear sisters.'
I declare I am interested in this story, and wish I had been there.
The gardener, whom I shall now call the muleteer, was a little, hearty,
broad-set, good-natured, chattering, toping kind of a fellow, who troubled
his head very little with the hows and whens of life; so had mortgaged a
month of his conventical wages in a borrachio, or leathern cask of wine,
which he had disposed behind the calesh, with a large russet-coloured
riding-coat over it, to guard it from the sun; and as the weather was hot,
and he not a niggard of his labours, walking ten times more than he rode--
he found more occasions than those of nature, to fall back to the rear of
his carriage; till by frequent coming and going, it had so happen'd, that
all his wine had leak'd out at the legal vent of the borrachio, before one
half of the journey was finish'd.
Man is a creature born to habitudes. The day had been sultry--the evening
was delicious--the wine was generous--the Burgundian hill on which it grew
was steep--a little tempting bush over the door of a cool cottage at the
foot of it, hung vibrating in full harmony with the passions--a gentle air
rustled distinctly through the leaves--'Come--come, thirsty muleteer,--come
in.'
--The muleteer was a son of Adam, I need not say a word more. He gave the
mules, each of 'em, a sound lash, and looking in the abbess's and
Margarita's faces (as he did it)--as much as to say 'here I am'--he gave a
second good crack--as much as to say to his mules, 'get on'--so slinking
behind, he enter'd the little inn at the foot of the hill.
The muleteer, as I told you, was a little, joyous, chirping fellow, who
thought not of to-morrow, nor of what had gone before, or what was to
follow it, provided he got but his scantling of Burgundy, and a little
chit-chat along with it; so entering into a long conversation, as how he
was chief gardener to the convent of Andouillets, &c. &c. and out of
friendship for the abbess and Mademoiselle Margarita, who was only in her
noviciate, he had come along with them from the confines of Savoy, &c. &c.-
-and as how she had got a white swelling by her devotions--and what a
nation of herbs he had procured to mollify her humours, &c. &c. and that if
the waters of Bourbon did not mend that leg--she might as well be lame of
both--&c. &c. &c.--He so contrived his story, as absolutely to forget the
heroine of it--and with her the little novice, and what was a more ticklish
point to be forgot than both--the two mules; who being creatures that take
advantage of the world, inasmuch as their parents took it of them--and they
not being in a condition to return the obligation downwards (as men and
women and beasts are)--they do it side-ways, and long-ways, and back-ways--
and up hill, and down hill, and which way they can.--Philosophers, with all
their ethicks, have never considered this rightly--how should the poor
muleteer, then in his cups, consider it at all? he did not in the least--
'tis time we do; let us leave him then in the vortex of his element, the
happiest and most thoughtless of mortal men--and for a moment let us look
after the mules, the abbess, and Margarita.
By virtue of the muleteer's two last strokes the mules had gone quietly on,
following their own consciences up the hill, till they had conquer'd about
one half of it; when the elder of them, a shrewd crafty old devil, at the
turn of an angle, giving a side glance, and no muleteer behind them,--
By my fig! said she, swearing, I'll go no further--And if I do, replied the
other, they shall make a drum of my hide.--
And so with one consent they stopp'd thus--
Chapter 4.III.
--Get on with you, said the abbess.
--Wh...ysh--ysh--cried Margarita.
Sh...a--shu..u--shu..u--sh..aw--shaw'd the abbess.
--Whu--v--w--whew--w--w--whuv'd Margarita, pursing up her sweet lips
betwixt a hoot and a whistle.
Thump--thump--thump--obstreperated the abbess of Andouillets with the end
of her gold-headed cane against the bottom of the calesh--
The old mule let a f... 
Chapter 4.IV.
We are ruin'd and undone, my child, said the abbess to Margarita,--we shall
be here all night--we shall be plunder'd--we shall be ravished--
--We shall be ravish'd, said Margarita, as sure as a gun.
Sancta Maria! cried the abbess (forgetting the O!)--why was I govern'd by
this wicked stiff joint? why did I leave the convent of Andouillets? and
why didst thou not suffer thy servant to go unpolluted to her tomb?
O my finger! my finger! cried the novice, catching fire at the word
servant--why was I not content to put it here, or there, any where rather
than be in this strait?
Strait! said the abbess.
Strait--said the novice; for terror had struck their understandings--the
one knew not what she said--the other what she answer'd.
O my virginity! virginity! cried the abbess.
...inity! ...inity! said the novice, sobbing.
Chapter 4.V.
My dear mother, quoth the novice, coming a little to herself,--there are
two certain words, which I have been told will force any horse, or ass, or
mule, to go up a hill whether he will or no; be he never so obstinate or
ill-will'd, the moment he hears them utter'd, he obeys. They are words
magic! cried the abbess in the utmost horror--No; replied Margarita calmly-
-but they are words sinful--What are they? quoth the abbess, interrupting
her: They are sinful in the first degree, answered Margarita,--they are
mortal--and if we are ravished and die unabsolved of them, we shall both-
but you may pronounce them to me, quoth the abbess of Andouillets--They
cannot, my dear mother, said the novice, be pronounced at all; they will
make all the blood in one's body fly up into one's face--But you may
whisper them in my ear, quoth the abbess.
Heaven! hadst thou no guardian angel to delegate to the inn at the bottom
of the hill? was there no generous and friendly spirit unemployed--no agent
in nature, by some monitory shivering, creeping along the artery which led
to his heart, to rouse the muleteer from his banquet?--no sweet minstrelsy
to bring back the fair idea of the abbess and Margarita, with their black
rosaries!
Rouse! rouse!--but 'tis too late--the horrid words are pronounced this
moment--
--and how to tell them--Ye, who can speak of every thing existing, with
unpolluted lips--instruct me--guide me--
Chapter 4.VI.
All sins whatever, quoth the abbess, turning casuist in the distress they
were under, are held by the confessor of our convent to be either mortal or
venial: there is no further division. Now a venial sin being the
slightest and least of all sins--being halved--by taking either only the
half of it, and leaving the rest--or, by taking it all, and amicably
halving it betwixt yourself and another person--in course becomes diluted
into no sin at all.
Now I see no sin in saying, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, a hundred times
together; nor is there any turpitude in pronouncing the syllable ger, ger,
ger, ger, ger, were it from our matins to our vespers: Therefore, my dear
daughter, continued the abbess of Andouillets--I will say bou, and thou
shalt say ger; and then alternately, as there is no more sin in fou than in
bou--Thou shalt say fou--and I will come in (like fa, sol, la, re, mi, ut,
at our complines) with ter. And accordingly the abbess, giving the pitch
note, set off thus:
Abbess,.....) Bou...bou...bou..
Margarita,..) ---ger,..ger,..ger.
Margarita,..) Fou...fou...fou..
Abbess,.....) ---ter,..ter,..ter.
The two mules acknowledged the notes by a mutual lash of their tails; but
it went no further--'Twill answer by an' by, said the novice.
Abbess,.....) Bou. bou. bou. bou. bou. bou.
Margarita,..) ---ger, ger, ger, ger, ger, ger.
Quicker still, cried Margarita. Fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou, fou,
fou.
Quicker still, cried Margarita. Bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou, bou,
bou.
Quicker still--God preserve me; said the abbess--They do not understand us,
cried Margarita--But the Devil does, said the abbess of Andouillets.
Chapter 4.VII.
What a tract of country have I run!--how many degrees nearer to the warm
sun am I advanced, and how many fair and goodly cities have I seen, during
the time you have been reading and reflecting, Madam, upon this story! 
There's Fontainbleau, and Sens, and Joigny, and Auxerre, and Dijon the
capital of Burgundy, and Challon, and Macon the capital of the Maconese,
and a score more upon the road to Lyons--and now I have run them over--I
might as well talk to you of so many market towns in the moon, as tell you
one word about them: it will be this chapter at the least, if not both
this and the next entirely lost, do what I will--
--Why, 'tis a strange story! Tristram.
Alas! Madam, had it been upon some melancholy lecture of the cross--the
peace of meekness, or the contentment of resignation--I had not been
incommoded: or had I thought of writing it upon the purer abstractions of
the soul, and that food of wisdom and holiness and contemplation, upon
which the spirit of man (when separated from the body) is to subsist for
ever--You would have come with a better appetite from it--
--I wish I never had wrote it: but as I never blot any thing out--let us
use some honest means to get it out of our heads directly.
--Pray reach me my fool's cap--I fear you sit upon it, Madam--'tis under
the cushion--I'll put it on--
Bless me! you have had it upon your head this half hour.--There then let it
stay, with a
Fa-ra diddle di
and a fa-ri diddle d
and a high-dum--dye-dum
fiddle. . .dumb-c.
And now, Madam, we may venture, I hope a little to go on.
Chapter 4.VIII.
--All you need say of Fontainbleau (in case you are ask'd) is, that it
stands about forty miles (south something) from Paris, in the middle of a
large forest--That there is something great in it--That the king goes there
once every two or three years, with his whole court, for the pleasure of
the chace--and that, during that carnival of sporting, any English
gentleman of fashion (you need not forget yourself) may be accommodated
with a nag or two, to partake of the sport, taking care only not to out-
gallop the king--
Though there are two reasons why you need not talk loud of this to every
one.
First, Because 'twill make the said nags the harder to be got; and
Secondly, 'Tis not a word of it true.--Allons!
As for Sens--you may dispatch--in a word--''Tis an archiepiscopal see.'
--For Joigny--the less, I think, one says of it the better.
But for Auxerre--I could go on for ever: for in my grand tour through
Europe, in which, after all, my father (not caring to trust me with any
one) attended me himself, with my uncle Toby, and Trim, and Obadiah, and
indeed most of the family, except my mother, who being taken up with a
project of knitting my father a pair of large worsted breeches--(the thing
is common sense)--and she not caring to be put out of her way, she staid at
home, at Shandy Hall, to keep things right during the expedition; in which,
I say, my father stopping us two days at Auxerre, and his researches being
ever of such a nature, that they would have found fruit even in a desert--
he has left me enough to say upon Auxerre: in short, wherever my father
went--but 'twas more remarkably so, in this journey through France and
Italy, than in any other stages of his life--his road seemed to lie so much
on one side of that, wherein all other travellers have gone before him--he
saw kings and courts and silks of all colours, in such strange lights--and
his remarks and reasonings upon the characters, the manners, and customs of
the countries we pass'd over, were so opposite to those of all other mortal
men, particularly those of my uncle Toby and Trim--(to say nothing of
myself)--and to crown all--the occurrences and scrapes which we were
perpetually meeting and getting into, in consequence of his systems and
opiniotry--they were of so odd, so mix'd and tragi-comical a contexture--
That the whole put together, it appears of so different a shade and tint
from any tour of Europe, which was ever executed--that I will venture to
pronounce--the fault must be mine and mine only--if it be not read by all
travellers and travel-readers, till travelling is no more,--or which comes
to the same point--till the world, finally, takes it into its head to stand
still.--
--But this rich bale is not to be open'd now; except a small thread or two
of it, merely to unravel the mystery of my father's stay at Auxerre.
--As I have mentioned it--'tis too slight to be kept suspended; and when
'tis wove in, there is an end of it.
We'll go, brother Toby, said my father, whilst dinner is coddling--to the
abbey of Saint Germain, if it be only to see these bodies, of which
Monsieur Sequier has given such a recommendation.--I'll go see any body,
quoth my uncle Toby; for he was all compliance through every step of the
journey--Defend me! said my father--they are all mummies--Then one need not
shave; quoth my uncle Toby--Shave! no--cried my father--'twill be more like
relations to go with our beards on--So out we sallied, the corporal lending
his master his arm, and bringing up the rear, to the abbey of Saint
Germain.
Every thing is very fine, and very rich, and very superb, and very
magnificent, said my father, addressing himself to the sacristan, who was a
younger brother of the order of Benedictines--but our curiosity has led us
to see the bodies, of which Monsieur Sequier has given the world so exact a
description.--The sacristan made a bow, and lighting a torch first, which
he had always in the vestry ready for the purpose; he led us into the tomb
of St. Heribald--This, said the sacristan, laying his hand upon the tomb,
was a renowned prince of the house of Bavaria, who under the successive
reigns of Charlemagne, Louis le Debonnair, and Charles the Bald, bore a
great sway in the government, and had a principal hand in bringing every
thing into order and discipline--
Then he has been as great, said my uncle, in the field, as in the cabinet--
I dare say he has been a gallant soldier--He was a monk--said the
sacristan.
My uncle Toby and Trim sought comfort in each other's faces--but found it
not: my father clapped both his hands upon his cod-piece, which was a way
he had when any thing hugely tickled him: for though he hated a monk and
the very smell of a monk worse than all the devils in hell--yet the shot
hitting my uncle Toby and Trim so much harder than him, 'twas a relative
triumph; and put him into the gayest humour in the world.
--And pray what do you call this gentleman? quoth my father, rather
sportingly: This tomb, said the young Benedictine, looking downwards,
contains the bones of Saint Maxima, who came from Ravenna on purpose to
touch the body--
--Of Saint Maximus, said my father, popping in with his saint before him,--
they were two of the greatest saints in the whole martyrology, added my
father--Excuse me, said the sacristan--'twas to touch the bones of Saint
Germain, the builder of the abbey--And what did she get by it? said my
uncle Toby--What does any woman get by it? said my father--Martyrdome;
replied the young Benedictine, making a bow down to the ground, and
uttering the word with so humble, but decisive a cadence, it disarmed my
father for a moment. 'Tis supposed, continued the Benedictine, that St.
Maxima has lain in this tomb four hundred years, and two hundred before her
canonization--'Tis but a slow rise, brother Toby, quoth my father, in this
self-same army of martyrs.--A desperate slow one, an' please your honour,
said Trim, unless one could purchase--I should rather sell out entirely,
quoth my uncle Toby--I am pretty much of your opinion, brother Toby, said
my father.
--Poor St. Maxima! said my uncle Toby low to himself, as we turn'd from her
tomb: She was one of the fairest and most beautiful ladies either of Italy
or France, continued the sacristan--But who the duce has got lain down
here, besides her? quoth my father, pointing with his cane to a large tomb
as we walked on--It is Saint Optat, Sir, answered the sacristan--And
properly is Saint Optat plac'd! said my father: And what is Saint Optat's
story? continued he. Saint Optat, replied the sacristan, was a bishop--
--I thought so, by heaven! cried my father, interrupting him--Saint Optat!-
-how should Saint Optat fail? so snatching out his pocket-book, and the
young Benedictine holding him the torch as he wrote, he set it down as a
new prop to his system of Christian names, and I will be bold to say, so
disinterested was he in the search of truth, that had he found a treasure
in Saint Optat's tomb, it would not have made him half so rich: 'Twas as
successful a short visit as ever was paid to the dead; and so highly was
his fancy pleas'd with all that had passed in it,--that he determined at
once to stay another day in Auxerre.
--I'll see the rest of these good gentry to-morrow, said my father, as we
cross'd over the square--And while you are paying that visit, brother
Shandy, quoth my uncle Toby--the corporal and I will mount the ramparts.
Chapter 4.IX.
--Now this is the most puzzled skein of all--for in this last chapter, as
far at least as it has help'd me through Auxerre, I have been getting
forwards in two different journies together, and with the same dash of the
pen--for I have got entirely out of Auxerre in this journey which I am
writing now, and I am got half way out of Auxerre in that which I shall
write hereafter--There is but a certain degree of perfection in every
thing; and by pushing at something beyond that, I have brought myself into
such a situation, as no traveller ever stood before me; for I am this
moment walking across the market-place of Auxerre with my father and my
uncle Toby, in our way back to dinner--and I am this moment also entering
Lyons with my post-chaise broke into a thousand pieces--and I am moreover
this moment in a handsome pavillion built by Pringello (The same Don
Pringello, the celebrated Spanish architect, of whom my cousin Antony has
made such honourable mention in a scholium to the Tale inscribed to his
name. Vid. p.129, small edit.), upon the banks of the Garonne, which Mons.
Sligniac has lent me, and where I now sit rhapsodising all these affairs.
--Let me collect myself, and pursue my journey.
Chapter 4.X.
I am glad of it, said I, settling the account with myself, as I walk'd into
Lyons--my chaise being all laid higgledy-piggledy with my baggage in a
cart, which was moving slowly before me--I am heartily glad, said I, that
'tis all broke to pieces; for now I can go directly by water to Avignon,
which will carry me on a hundred and twenty miles of my journey, and not
cost me seven livres--and from thence, continued I, bringing forwards the
account, I can hire a couple of mules--or asses, if I like, (for nobody
knows me,) and cross the plains of Languedoc for almost nothing--I shall
gain four hundred livres by the misfortune clear into my purse: and
pleasure! worth--worth double the money by it. With what velocity,
continued I, clapping my two hands together, shall I fly down the rapid
Rhone, with the Vivares on my right hand, and Dauphiny on my left, scarce
seeing the ancient cities of Vienne, Valence, and Vivieres. What a flame
will it rekindle in the lamp, to snatch a blushing grape from the Hermitage
and Cote roti, as I shoot by the foot of them! and what a fresh spring in
the blood! to behold upon the banks advancing and retiring, the castles of
romance, whence courteous knights have whilome rescued the distress'd--and
see vertiginous, the rocks, the mountains, the cataracts, and all the hurry
which Nature is in with all her great works about her.
As I went on thus, methought my chaise, the wreck of which look'd stately
enough at the first, insensibly grew less and less in its size; the
freshness of the painting was no more--the gilding lost its lustre--and the
whole affair appeared so poor in my eyes--so sorry!--so contemptible! and,
in a word, so much worse than the abbess of Andouillets' itself--that I was
just opening my mouth to give it to the devil--when a pert vamping chaise-
undertaker, stepping nimbly across the street, demanded if Monsieur would
have his chaise refitted--No, no, said I, shaking my head sideways--Would
Monsieur choose to sell it? rejoined the undertaker--With all my soul, said
I--the iron work is worth forty livres--and the glasses worth forty more--
and the leather you may take to live on.
What a mine of wealth, quoth I, as he counted me the money, has this post-
chaise brought me in? And this is my usual method of book-keeping, at
least with the disasters of life--making a penny of every one of 'em as
they happen to me--
--Do, my dear Jenny, tell the world for me, how I behaved under one, the
most oppressive of its kind, which could befal me as a man, proud as he
ought to be of his manhood--
'Tis enough, saidst thou, coming close up to me, as I stood with my garters
in my hand, reflecting upon what had not pass'd--'Tis enough, Tristram, and
I am satisfied, saidst thou, whispering these words in my ear, .... .. ....
... ......;--...... ...--any other man would have sunk down to the centre--
--Every thing is good for something, quoth I.
--I'll go into Wales for six weeks, and drink goat's whey--and I'll gain
seven years longer life for the accident. For which reason I think myself
inexcusable, for blaming Fortune so often as I have done, for pelting me
all my life long, like an ungracious duchess, as I call'd her, with so many
small evils: surely, if I have any cause to be angry with her, 'tis that
she has not sent me great ones--a score of good cursed, bouncing losses,
would have been as good as a pension to me.
--One of a hundred a year, or so, is all I wish--I would not be at the
plague of paying land-tax for a larger.
Chapter 4.XI.
To those who call vexations, Vexations, as knowing what they are, there
could not be a greater, than to be the best part of a day at Lyons, the
most opulent and flourishing city in France, enriched with the most
fragments of antiquity--and not be able to see it. To be withheld upon any
account, must be a vexation; but to be withheld by a vexation--must
certainly be, what philosophy justly calls 
Vexation 
upon 
Vexation.
I had got my two dishes of milk coffee (which by the bye is excellently
good for a consumption, but you must boil the milk and coffee together--
otherwise 'tis only coffee and milk)--and as it was no more than eight in
the morning, and the boat did not go off till noon, I had time to see
enough of Lyons to tire the patience of all the friends I had in the world
with it. I will take a walk to the cathedral, said I, looking at my list,
and see the wonderful mechanism of this great clock of Lippius of Basil, in
the first place--
Now, of all things in the world, I understand the least of mechanism--I
have neither genius, or taste, or fancy--and have a brain so entirely unapt
for every thing of that kind, that I solemnly declare I was never yet able
to comprehend the principles of motion of a squirrel cage, or a common
knife-grinder's wheel--tho' I have many an hour of my life look'd up with
great devotion at the one--and stood by with as much patience as any
christian ever could do, at the other--
I'll go see the surprising movements of this great clock, said I, the very
first thing I do: and then I will pay a visit to the great library of the
Jesuits, and procure, if possible, a sight of the thirty volumes of the
general history of China, wrote (not in the Tartarean, but) in the Chinese
language, and in the Chinese character too.
Now I almost know as little of the Chinese language, as I do of the
mechanism of Lippius's clock-work; so, why these should have jostled
themselves into the two first articles of my list--I leave to the curious
as a problem of Nature. I own it looks like one of her ladyship's
obliquities; and they who court her, are interested in finding out her
humour as much as I.
When these curiosities are seen, quoth I, half addressing myself to my
valet de place, who stood behind me--'twill be no hurt if we go to the
church of St. Irenaeus, and see the pillar to which Christ was tied--and
after that, the house where Pontius Pilate lived--'Twas at the next town,
said the valet de place--at Vienne; I am glad of it, said I, rising briskly
from my chair, and walking across the room with strides twice as long as my
usual pace--'for so much the sooner shall I be at the Tomb of the two
lovers.'
What was the cause of this movement, and why I took such long strides in
uttering this--I might leave to the curious too; but as no principle of
clock-work is concerned in it--'twill be as well for the reader if I
explain it myself.
Chapter 4.XII.
O! there is a sweet aera in the life of man, when (the brain being tender
and fibrillous, and more like pap than any thing else)--a story read of two
fond lovers, separated from each other by cruel parents, and by still more
cruel destiny--
Amandus--He
Amanda--She--
each ignorant of the other's course,
He--east
She--west
Amandus taken captive by the Turks, and carried to the emperor of Morocco's
court, where the princess of Morocco falling in love with him, keeps him
twenty years in prison for the love of his Amanda.--
She--(Amanda) all the time wandering barefoot, and with dishevell'd hair,
o'er rocks and mountains, enquiring for Amandus!--Amandus! Amandus!--making
every hill and valley to echo back his name--
Amandus! Amandus!
at every town and city, sitting down forlorn at the gate--Has Amandus!--has
my Amandus enter'd?--till,--going round, and round, and round the world--
chance unexpected bringing them at the same moment of the night, though by
different ways, to the gate of Lyons, their native city, and each in well-
known accents calling out aloud,
Is Amandus / Is my Amanda still alive?
they fly into each other's arms, and both drop down dead for joy.
There is a soft aera in every gentle mortal's life, where such a story
affords more pabulum to the brain, than all the Frusts, and Crusts, and
Rusts of antiquity, which travellers can cook up for it.
--'Twas all that stuck on the right side of the cullender in my own, of
what Spon and others, in their accounts of Lyons, had strained into it; and
finding, moreover, in some Itinerary, but in what God knows--That sacred to
the fidelity of Amandus and Amanda, a tomb was built without the gates,
where, to this hour, lovers called upon them to attest their truths--I
never could get into a scrape of that kind in my life, but this tomb of the
lovers would, somehow or other, come in at the close--nay such a kind of
empire had it establish'd over me, that I could seldom think or speak of
Lyons--and sometimes not so much as see even a Lyons-waistcoat, but this
remnant of antiquity would present itself to my fancy; and I have often
said in my wild way of running on--tho' I fear with some irreverence--'I
thought this shrine (neglected as it was) as valuable as that of Mecca, and
so little short, except in wealth, of the Santa Casa itself, that some time
or other, I would go a pilgrimage (though I had no other business at Lyons)
on purpose to pay it a visit.'
In my list, therefore, of Videnda at Lyons, this, tho' last,--was not, you
see, least; so taking a dozen or two of longer strides than usual cross my
room, just whilst it passed my brain, I walked down calmly into the basse
cour, in order to sally forth; and having called for my bill--as it was
uncertain whether I should return to my inn, I had paid it--had moreover
given the maid ten sous, and was just receiving the dernier compliments of
Monsieur Le Blanc, for a pleasant voyage down the Rhone--when I was stopped
at the gate--
Chapter 4.XIII.
--'Twas by a poor ass, who had just turned in with a couple of large
panniers upon his back, to collect eleemosynary turnip-tops and cabbage-
leaves; and stood dubious, with his two fore-feet on the inside of the
threshold, and with his two hinder feet towards the street, as not knowing
very well whether he was to go in or no.
Now, 'tis an animal (be in what hurry I may) I cannot bear to strike--there
is a patient endurance of sufferings, wrote so unaffectedly in his looks
and carriage, which pleads so mightily for him, that it always disarms me;
and to that degree, that I do not like to speak unkindly to him: on the
contrary, meet him where I will--whether in town or country--in cart or
under panniers--whether in liberty or bondage--I have ever something civil
to say to him on my part; and as one word begets another (if he has as
little to do as I)--I generally fall into conversation with him; and surely
never is my imagination so busy as in framing his responses from the
etchings of his countenance--and where those carry me not deep enough--in
flying from my own heart into his, and seeing what is natural for an ass to
think--as well as a man, upon the occasion. In truth, it is the only
creature of all the classes of beings below me, with whom I can do this: 
for parrots, jackdaws, &c.--I never exchange a word with them--nor with the
apes, &c. for pretty near the same reason; they act by rote, as the others
speak by it, and equally make me silent: nay my dog and my cat, though I
value them both--(and for my dog he would speak if he could)--yet somehow
or other, they neither of them possess the talents for conversation--I can
make nothing of a discourse with them, beyond the proposition, the reply,
and rejoinder, which terminated my father's and my mother's conversations,
in his beds of justice--and those utter'd--there's an end of the dialogue--
--But with an ass, I can commune for ever.
Come, Honesty! said I,--seeing it was impracticable to pass betwixt him and
the gate--art thou for coming in, or going out?
The ass twisted his head round to look up the street--
Well--replied I--we'll wait a minute for thy driver:
--He turned his head thoughtful about, and looked wistfully the opposite
way--
I understand thee perfectly, answered I--If thou takest a wrong step in
this affair, he will cudgel thee to death--Well! a minute is but a minute,
and if it saves a fellow-creature a drubbing, it shall not be set down as
ill-spent.
He was eating the stem of an artichoke as this discourse went on, and in
the little peevish contentions of nature betwixt hunger and unsavouriness,
had dropt it out of his mouth half a dozen times, and pick'd it up again--
God help thee, Jack! said I, thou hast a bitter breakfast on't--and many a
bitter day's labour,--and many a bitter blow, I fear, for its wages--'tis
all--all bitterness to thee, whatever life is to others.--And now thy
mouth, if one knew the truth of it, is as bitter, I dare say, as soot--(for
he had cast aside the stem) and thou hast not a friend perhaps in all this
world, that will give thee a macaroon.--In saying this, I pull'd out a
paper of 'em, which I had just purchased, and gave him one--and at this
moment that I am telling it, my heart smites me, that there was more of
pleasantry in the conceit, of seeing how an ass would eat a macaroon--than
of benevolence in giving him one, which presided in the act.
When the ass had eaten his macaroon, I press'd him to come in--the poor
beast was heavy loaded--his legs seem'd to tremble under him--he hung
rather backwards, and as I pull'd at his halter, it broke short in my hand-
-he look'd up pensive in my face--'Don't thrash me with it--but if you
will, you may'--If I do, said I, I'll be d....d.
The word was but one-half of it pronounced, like the abbess of
Andouillet's--(so there was no sin in it)--when a person coming in, let
fall a thundering bastinado upon the poor devil's crupper, which put an end
to the ceremony.
Out upon it!
cried I--but the interjection was equivocal--and, I think, wrong placed
too--for the end of an osier which had started out from the contexture of
the ass's panier, had caught hold of my breeches pocket, as he rush'd by
me, and rent it in the most disastrous direction you can imagine--so that
the
Out upon it! in my opinion, should have come in here--but this I leave to
be settled by
The
Reviewers
of
My Breeches,
which I have brought over along with me for that purpose.
Chapter 4.XIV.
When all was set to rights, I came down stairs again into the basse cour
with my valet de place, in order to sally out towards the tomb of the two
lovers, &c.--and was a second time stopp'd at the gate--not by the ass--but
by the person who struck him; and who, by that time, had taken possession
(as is not uncommon after a defeat) of the very spot of ground where the
ass stood.
It was a commissary sent to me from the post-office, with a rescript in his
hand for the payment of some six livres odd sous.
Upon what account? said I.--'Tis upon the part of the king, replied the
commissary, heaving up both his shoulders--
--My good friend, quoth I--as sure as I am I--and you are you--
--And who are you? said he.--Don't puzzle me; said I.
Chapter 4.XV.
--But it is an indubitable verity, continued I, addressing myself to the
commissary, changing only the form of my asseveration--that I owe the king
of France nothing but my good will; for he is a very honest man, and I wish
him all health and pastime in the world--
Pardonnez moi--replied the commissary, you are indebted to him six livres
four sous, for the next post from hence to St. Fons, in your route to
Avignon--which being a post royal, you pay double for the horses and
postillion--otherwise 'twould have amounted to no more than three livres
two sous--
--But I don't go by land; said I.
--You may if you please; replied the commissary--
Your most obedient servant--said I, making him a low bow--
The commissary, with all the sincerity of grave good breeding--made me one,
as low again.--I never was more disconcerted with a bow in my life.
--The devil take the serious character of these people! quoth I--(aside)
they understand no more of Irony than this--
The comparison was standing close by with his panniers--but something
seal'd up my lips--I could not pronounce the name--
Sir, said I, collecting myself--it is not my intention to take post--
--But you may--said he, persisting in his first reply--you may take post if
you chuse--
--And I may take salt to my pickled herring, said I, if I chuse--
--But I do not chuse--
--But you must pay for it, whether you do or no.
Aye! for the salt; said I (I know)--
--And for the post too; added he. Defend me! cried I--
I travel by water--I am going down the Rhone this very afternoon--my
baggage is in the boat--and I have actually paid nine livres for my
passage--
C'est tout egal--'tis all one; said he.
Bon Dieu! what, pay for the way I go! and for the way I do not go!
--C'est tout egal; replied the commissary--
--The devil it is! said I--but I will go to ten thousand Bastiles first--
O England! England! thou land of liberty, and climate of good sense, thou
tenderest of mothers--and gentlest of nurses, cried I, kneeling upon one
knee, as I was beginning my apostrophe.
When the director of Madam Le Blanc's conscience coming in at that instant,
and seeing a person in black, with a face as pale as ashes, at his
devotions--looking still paler by the contrast and distress of his drapery-
-ask'd, if I stood in want of the aids of the church--
I go by Water--said I--and here's another will be for making me pay for
going by Oil.
Chapter 4.XVI.
As I perceived the commissary of the post-office would have his six livres
four sous, I had nothing else for it, but to say some smart thing upon the
occasion, worth the money:
And so I set off thus:--
--And pray, Mr. Commissary, by what law of courtesy is a defenceless
stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use a Frenchman in this
matter?
By no means; said he.
Excuse me; said I--for you have begun, Sir, with first tearing off my
breeches-and now you want my pocket--
Whereas--had you first taken my pocket, as you do with your own people--and
then left me bare a..'d after--I had been a beast to have complain'd--
As it is--
--'Tis contrary to the law of nature.
--'Tis contrary to reason.
--'Tis contrary to the Gospel.
But not to this--said he--putting a printed paper into my hand,
Par le Roy.
--'Tis a pithy prolegomenon, quoth I--and so read on. . ..
--By all which it appears, quoth I, having read it over, a little too
rapidly, that if a man sets out in a post-chaise from Paris--he must go on
travelling in one, all the days of his life--or pay for it.--Excuse me,
said the commissary, the spirit of the ordinance is this--That if you set
out with an intention of running post from Paris to Avignon, &c. you shall
not change that intention or mode of travelling, without first satisfying
the fermiers for two posts further than the place you repent at--and 'tis
founded, continued he, upon this, that the Revenues are not to fall short
through your fickleness--
--O by heavens! cried I--if fickleness is taxable in France--we have
nothing to do but to make the best peace with you we can--
And So the Peace Was Made;
--And if it is a bad one--as Tristram Shandy laid the corner-stone of it--
nobody but Tristram Shandy ought to be hanged.
Chapter 4.XVII.
Though I was sensible I had said as many clever things to the commissary 
as came to six livres four sous, yet I was determined to note down the
imposition amongst my remarks before I retired from the place; so putting
my hand into my coat-pocket for my remarks--(which, by the bye, may be a
caution to travellers to take a little more care of their remarks for the
future) 'my remarks were stolen'--Never did sorry traveller make such a
pother and racket about his remarks as I did about mine, upon the occasion.
Heaven! earth! sea! fire! cried I, calling in every thing to my aid but
what I should--My remarks are stolen!--what shall I do?--Mr. Commissary!
pray did I drop any remarks, as I stood besides you?--
You dropp'd a good many very singular ones; replied he--Pugh! said I, those
were but a few, not worth above six livres two sous--but these are a large
parcel--He shook his head--Monsieur Le Blanc! Madam Le Blanc! did you see
any papers of mine?--you maid of the house! run up stairs--Francois! run up
after her--
--I must have my remarks--they were the best remarks, cried I, that ever
were made--the wisest--the wittiest--What shall I do?--which way shall I
turn myself?
Sancho Panca, when he lost his ass's Furniture, did not exclaim more
bitterly.
Chapter 4.XVIII.
When the first transport was over, and the registers of the brain were
beginning to get a little out of the confusion into which this jumble of
cross accidents had cast them--it then presently occurr'd to me, that I had
left my remarks in the pocket of the chaise--and that in selling my chaise,
I had sold my remarks along with it, to the chaise-vamper. I leave
this void space that the reader may swear into it any oath that he is most
accustomed to--For my own part, if ever I swore a whole oath into a vacancy
in my life, I think it was into that--........., said I--and so my remarks
through France, which were as full of wit, as an egg is full of meat, and
as well worth four hundred guineas, as the said egg is worth a penny--have
I been selling here to a chaise-vamper--for four Louis d'Ors--and giving
him a post-chaise (by heaven) worth six into the bargain; had it been to
Dodsley, or Becket, or any creditable bookseller, who was either leaving
off business, and wanted a post-chaise--or who was beginning it--and wanted
my remarks, and two or three guineas along with them--I could have borne
it--but to a chaise-vamper!--shew me to him this moment, Francois,--said I-
-The valet de place put on his hat, and led the way--and I pull'd off mine,
as I pass'd the commissary, and followed him.
Chapter 4.XIX.
When we arrived at the chaise-vamper's house, both the house and the shop
were shut up; it was the eighth of September, the nativity of the blessed
Virgin Mary, mother of God--
--Tantarra-ra-tan-tivi--the whole world was gone out a May-poling--frisking
here--capering there--no body cared a button for me or my remarks; so I sat
me down upon a bench by the door, philosophating upon my condition: by a
better fate than usually attends me, I had not waited half an hour, when
the mistress came in to take the papilliotes from off her hair, before she
went to the May-poles--
The French women, by the bye, love May-poles, a la folie--that is, as much
as their matins--give 'em but a May-pole, whether in May, June, July or
September--they never count the times--down it goes--'tis meat, drink,
washing, and lodging to 'em--and had we but the policy, an' please your
worships (as wood is a little scarce in France), to send them but plenty of
May-poles--
The women would set them up; and when they had done, they would dance round
them (and the men for company) till they were all blind.
The wife of the chaise-vamper stepp'd in, I told you, to take the
papilliotes from off her hair--the toilet stands still for no man--so she
jerk'd off her cap, to begin with them as she open'd the door, in doing
which, one of them fell upon the ground--I instantly saw it was my own
writing--
O Seigneur! cried I--you have got all my remarks upon your head, Madam!--
J'en suis bien mortifiee, said she--'tis well, thinks I, they have stuck
there--for could they have gone deeper, they would have made such confusion
in a French woman's noddle--She had better have gone with it unfrizled, to
the day of eternity.
Tenez--said she--so without any idea of the nature of my suffering, she
took them from her curls, and put them gravely one by one into my hat--one
was twisted this way--another twisted that--ey! by my faith; and when they
are published, quoth I,--
They will be worse twisted still.
Chapter 4.XX.
And now for Lippius's clock! said I, with the air of a man, who had got
thro' all his difficulties--nothing can prevent us seeing that, and the
Chinese history, &c. except the time, said Francois--for 'tis almost
eleven--then we must speed the faster, said I, striding it away to the
cathedral.
I cannot say, in my heart, that it gave me any concern in being told by one
of the minor canons, as I was entering the west door,--That Lippius's great
clock was all out of joints, and had not gone for some years--It will give
me the more time, thought I, to peruse the Chinese history; and besides I
shall be able to give the world a better account of the clock in its decay,
than I could have done in its flourishing condition--
--And so away I posted to the college of the Jesuits.
Now it is with the project of getting a peep at the history of China in
Chinese characters--as with many others I could mention, which strike the
fancy only at a distance; for as I came nearer and nearer to the point--my
blood cool'd--the freak gradually went off, till at length I would not have
given a cherry-stone to have it gratified--The truth was, my time was
short, and my heart was at the Tomb of the Lovers--I wish to God, said I,
as I got the rapper in my hand, that the key of the library may be but
lost; it fell out as well--
For all the Jesuits had got the cholic--and to that degree, as never was
known in the memory of the oldest practitioner.
Chapter 4.XXI.
As I knew the geography of the Tomb of the Lovers, as well as if I had
lived twenty years in Lyons, namely, that it was upon the turning of my
right hand, just without the gate, leading to the Fauxbourg de Vaise--I
dispatched Francois to the boat, that I might pay the homage I so long ow'd
it, without a witness of my weakness--I walk'd with all imaginable joy
towards the place--when I saw the gate which intercepted the tomb, my heart
glowed within me--
--Tender and faithful spirits! cried I, addressing myself to Amandus and
Amanda--long--long have I tarried to drop this tear upon your tomb--I come-
-I come--
When I came--there was no tomb to drop it upon.
What would I have given for my uncle Toby, to have whistled Lillo bullero!
Chapter 4.XXII.
No matter how, or in what mood--but I flew from the tomb of the lovers--or
rather I did not fly from it--(for there was no such thing existing) and
just got time enough to the boat to save my passage;--and ere I had sailed
a hundred yards, the Rhone and the Saon met together, and carried me down
merrily betwixt them.
But I have described this voyage down the Rhone, before I made it--
--So now I am at Avignon, and as there is nothing to see but the old house,
in which the duke of Ormond resided, and nothing to stop me but a short
remark upon the place, in three minutes you will see me crossing the bridge
upon a mule, with Francois upon a horse with my portmanteau behind him, and
the owner of both, striding the way before us, with a long gun upon his
shoulder, and a sword under his arm, lest peradventure we should run away
with his cattle. Had you seen my breeches in entering Avignon,--Though
you'd have seen them better, I think, as I mounted--you would not have
thought the precaution amiss, or found in your heart to have taken it in
dudgeon; for my own part, I took it most kindly; and determined to make him
a present of them, when we got to the end of our journey, for the trouble
they had put him to, of arming himself at all points against them.
Before I go further, let me get rid of my remark upon Avignon, which is
this: That I think it wrong, merely because a man's hat has been blown off
his head by chance the first night he comes to Avignon,--that he should
therefore say, 'Avignon is more subject to high winds than any town in all
France:' for which reason I laid no stress upon the accident till I had
enquired of the master of the inn about it, who telling me seriously it was
so--and hearing, moreover, the windiness of Avignon spoke of in the country
about as a proverb--I set it down, merely to ask the learned what can be
the cause--the consequence I saw--for they are all Dukes, Marquisses, and
Counts, there--the duce a Baron, in all Avignon--so that there is scarce
any talking to them on a windy day.
Prithee, friend, said I, take hold of my mule for a moment--for I wanted to
pull off one of my jack-boots, which hurt my heel--the man was standing
quite idle at the door of the inn, and as I had taken it into my head, he
was someway concerned about the house or stable, I put the bridle into his
hand--so begun with the boot:--when I had finished the affair, I turned
about to take the mule from the man, and thank him--
--But Monsieur le Marquis had walked in--
Chapter 4.XXIII.
I had now the whole south of France, from the banks of the Rhone to those
of the Garonne, to traverse upon my mule at my own leisure--at my own
leisure--for I had left Death, the Lord knows--and He only--how far behind
me--'I have followed many a man thro' France, quoth he--but never at this
mettlesome rate.'--Still he followed,--and still I fled him--but I fled him
cheerfully--still he pursued--but, like one who pursued his prey without
hope--as he lagg'd, every step he lost, softened his looks--why should I
fly him at this rate?
So notwithstanding all the commissary of the post-office had said, I
changed the mode of my travelling once more; and, after so precipitate and
rattling a course as I had run, I flattered my fancy with thinking of my
mule, and that I should traverse the rich plains of Languedoc upon his
back, as slowly as foot could fall.
There is nothing more pleasing to a traveller--or more terrible to travel-
writers, than a large rich plain; especially if it is without great rivers
or bridges; and presents nothing to the eye, but one unvaried picture of
plenty: for after they have once told you, that 'tis delicious! or
delightful! (as the case happens)--that the soil was grateful, and that
nature pours out all her abundance, &c. . .they have then a large plain
upon their hands, which they know not what to do with--and which is of
little or no use to them but to carry them to some town; and that town,
perhaps of little more, but a new place to start from to the next plain--
and so on.
--This is most terrible work; judge if I don't manage my plains better.
Chapter 4.XXIV.
I had not gone above two leagues and a half, before the man with his gun
began to look at his priming.
I had three several times loiter'd terribly behind; half a mile at least
every time; once, in deep conference with a drum-maker, who was making
drums for the fairs of Baucaira and Tarascone--I did not understand the
principles--
The second time, I cannot so properly say, I stopp'd--for meeting a couple
of Franciscans straitened more for time than myself, and not being able to
get to the bottom of what I was about--I had turn'd back with them--
The third, was an affair of trade with a gossip, for a hand-basket of
Provence figs for four sous; this would have been transacted at once; but
for a case of conscience at the close of it; for when the figs were paid
for, it turn'd out, that there were two dozen of eggs covered over with
vine-leaves at the bottom of the basket--as I had no intention of buying
eggs--I made no sort of claim of them--as for the space they had occupied--
what signified it? I had figs enow for my money--
--But it was my intention to have the basket--it was the gossip's intention
to keep it, without which, she could do nothing with her eggs--and unless I
had the basket, I could do as little with my figs, which were too ripe
already, and most of 'em burst at the side: this brought on a short
contention, which terminated in sundry proposals, what we should both do--
--How we disposed of our eggs and figs, I defy you, or the Devil himself,
had he not been there (which I am persuaded he was), to form the least
probable conjecture: You will read the whole of it--not this year, for I
am hastening to the story of my uncle Toby's amours--but you will read it
in the collection of those which have arose out of the journey across this
plain--and which, therefore, I call my
Plain Stories.
How far my pen has been fatigued, like those of other travellers, in this
journey of it, over so barren a track--the world must judge--but the traces
of it, which are now all set o' vibrating together this moment, tell me 'tis
the most fruitful and busy period of my life; for as I had made no
convention with my man with the gun, as to time--by stopping and talking to
every soul I met, who was not in a full trot--joining all parties before
me--waiting for every soul behind--hailing all those who were coming
through cross-roads--arresting all kinds of beggars, pilgrims, fiddlers,
friars--not passing by a woman in a mulberry-tree without commending her
legs, and tempting her into conversation with a pinch of snuff--In short,
by seizing every handle, of what size or shape soever, which chance held
out to me in this journey--I turned my plain into a city--I was always in
company, and with great variety too; and as my mule loved society as much
as myself, and had some proposals always on his part to offer to every
beast he met--I am confident we could have passed through Pall-Mall, or St.
James's-Street, for a month together, with fewer adventures--and seen less
of human nature.
O! there is that sprightly frankness, which at once unpins every plait of a
Languedocian's dress--that whatever is beneath it, it looks so like the
simplicity which poets sing of in better days--I will delude my fancy, and
believe it is so.
'Twas in the road betwixt Nismes and Lunel, where there is the best
Muscatto wine in all France, and which by the bye belongs to the honest
canons of Montpellier--and foul befal the man who has drunk it at their
table, who grudges them a drop of it.
--The sun was set--they had done their work; the nymphs had tied up their
hair afresh--and the swains were preparing for a carousal--my mule made a
dead point--'Tis the fife and tabourin, said I--I'm frighten'd to death,
quoth he--They are running at the ring of pleasure, said I, giving him a
prick--By saint Boogar, and all the saints at the backside of the door of
purgatory, said he--(making the same resolution with the abbesse of
Andouillets) I'll not go a step further--'Tis very well, sir, said I--I
never will argue a point with one of your family, as long as I live; so
leaping off his back, and kicking off one boot into this ditch, and t'other
into that--I'll take a dance, said I--so stay you here.
A sun-burnt daughter of Labour rose up from the groupe to meet me, as I
advanced towards them; her hair, which was a dark chesnut approaching
rather to a black, was tied up in a knot, all but a single tress.
We want a cavalier, said she, holding out both her hands, as if to offer
them--And a cavalier ye shall have; said I, taking hold of both of them.
Hadst thou, Nannette, been array'd like a duchesse!
--But that cursed slit in thy petticoat!
Nannette cared not for it.
We could not have done without you, said she, letting go one hand, with
self-taught politeness, leading me up with the other.
A lame youth, whom Apollo had recompensed with a pipe, and to which he had
added a tabourin of his own accord, ran sweetly over the prelude, as he sat
upon the bank--Tie me up this tress instantly, said Nannette, putting a
piece of string into my hand--It taught me to forget I was a stranger--The
whole knot fell down--We had been seven years acquainted.
The youth struck the note upon the tabourin--his pipe followed, and off we
bounded--'the duce take that slit!'
The sister of the youth, who had stolen her voice from heaven, sung
alternately with her brother--'twas a Gascoigne roundelay.
Viva la Joia!
Fidon la Tristessa!
The nymphs join'd in unison, and their swains an octave below them--
I would have given a crown to have it sew'd up--Nannette would not have
given a sous--Viva la joia! was in her lips--Viva la joia! was in her eyes. 
A transient spark of amity shot across the space betwixt us--She look'd
amiable!--Why could I not live, and end my days thus? Just Disposer of our
joys and sorrows, cried I, why could not a man sit down in the lap of
content here--and dance, and sing, and say his prayers, and go to heaven
with this nut-brown maid? Capriciously did she bend her head on one side,
and dance up insidious--Then 'tis time to dance off, quoth I; so changing
only partners and tunes, I danced it away from Lunel to Montpellier--from
thence to Pescnas, Beziers--I danced it along through Narbonne, Carcasson,
and Castle Naudairy, till at last I danced myself into Perdrillo's
pavillion, where pulling out a paper of black lines, that I might go on
straight forwards, without digression or parenthesis, in my uncle Toby's
amours--
I begun thus--
Chapter 4.XXV.
--But softly--for in these sportive plains, and under this genial sun,
where at this instant all flesh is running out piping, fiddling, and
dancing to the vintage, and every step that's taken, the judgment is
surprised by the imagination, I defy, notwithstanding all that has been
said upon straight lines (Vid. Vol. III.) in sundry pages of my book--I
defy the best cabbage planter that ever existed, whether he plants
backwards or forwards, it makes little difference in the account (except
that he will have more to answer for in the one case than in the other)--I
defy him to go on coolly, critically, and canonically, planting his
cabbages one by one, in straight lines, and stoical distances, especially
if slits in petticoats are unsew'd up--without ever and anon straddling
out, or sidling into some bastardly digression--In Freeze-land, Fog-land,
and some other lands I wot of--it may be done--
But in this clear climate of fantasy and perspiration, where every idea,
sensible and insensible, gets vent--in this land, my dear Eugenius--in this
fertile land of chivalry and romance, where I now sit, unskrewing my ink-
horn to write my uncle Toby's amours, and with all the meanders of Julia's
track in quest of her Diego, in full view of my study window--if thou
comest not and takest me by the hand--
What a work it is likely to turn out!
Let us begin it.
Chapter 4.XXVI.
It is with Love as with Cuckoldom--
But now I am talking of beginning a book, and have long had a thing upon my
mind to be imparted to the reader, which, if not imparted now, can never be
imparted to him as long as I live (whereas the Comparison may be imparted
to him any hour in the day)--I'll just mention it, and begin in good
earnest.
The thing is this.
That of all the several ways of beginning a book which are now in practice
throughout the known world, I am confident my own way of doing it is the
best--I'm sure it is the most religious--for I begin with writing the first
sentence--and trusting to Almighty God for the second.
'Twould cure an author for ever of the fuss and folly of opening his
street-door, and calling in his neighbours and friends, and kinsfolk, with
the devil and all his imps, with their hammers and engines, &c. only to
observe how one sentence of mine follows another, and how the plan follows
the whole.
I wish you saw me half starting out of my chair, with what confidence, as I
grasp the elbow of it, I look up--catching the idea, even sometimes before
it half way reaches me--
I believe in my conscience I intercept many a thought which heaven intended
for another man.
Pope and his Portrait (Vid. Pope's Portrait.) are fools to me--no martyr is
ever so full of faith or fire--I wish I could say of good works too--but I
have no
Zeal or Anger--or
Anger or Zeal--
And till gods and men agree together to call it by the same name--the
errantest Tartuffe, in science--in politics--or in religion, shall never
kindle a spark within me, or have a worse word, or a more unkind greeting,
than what he will read in the next chapter.
Chapter 4.XXVII.
--Bon jour!--good morrow!--so you have got your cloak on betimes!--but 'tis
a cold morning, and you judge the matter rightly--'tis better to be well
mounted, than go o' foot--and obstructions in the glands are dangerous--And
how goes it with thy concubine--thy wife,--and thy little ones o' both
sides? and when did you hear from the old gentleman and lady--your sister,
aunt, uncle, and cousins--I hope they have got better of their colds,
coughs, claps, tooth-aches, fevers, stranguries, sciaticas, swellings, and
sore eyes.
--What a devil of an apothecary! to take so much blood--give such a vile
purge--puke--poultice--plaister--night-draught--clyster--blister?--And why
so many grains of calomel? santa Maria! and such a dose of opium! peri-
clitating, pardi! the whole family of ye, from head to tail--By my great-
aunt Dinah's old black velvet mask! I think there is no occasion for it.
Now this being a little bald about the chin, by frequently putting off and
on, before she was got with child by the coachman--not one of our family
would wear it after. To cover the Mask afresh, was more than the mask was
worth--and to wear a mask which was bald, or which could be half seen
through, was as bad as having no mask at all--
This is the reason, may it please your reverences, that in all our numerous
family, for these four generations, we count no more than one archbishop, a
Welch judge, some three or four aldermen, and a single mountebank--
In the sixteenth century, we boast of no less than a dozen alchymists.
Chapter 4.XXVIII.
'It is with Love as with Cuckoldom'--the suffering party is at least the
third, but generally the last in the house who knows any thing about the
matter: this comes, as all the world knows, from having half a dozen words
for one thing; and so long, as what in this vessel of the human frame, is
Love--may be Hatred, in that--Sentiment half a yard higher--and Nonsense--
no, Madam,--not there--I mean at the part I am now pointing to with my
forefinger--how can we help ourselves?
Of all mortal, and immortal men too, if you please, who ever soliloquized
upon this mystic subject, my uncle Toby was the worst fitted, to have
push'd his researches, thro' such a contention of feelings; and he had
infallibly let them all run on, as we do worse matters, to see what they
would turn out--had not Bridget's pre-notification of them to Susannah, and
Susannah's repeated manifestoes thereupon to all the world, made it
necessary for my uncle Toby to look into the affair.
Chapter 4.XXIX.
Why weavers, gardeners, and gladiators--or a man with a pined leg
(proceeding from some ailment in the foot)--should ever have had some
tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them, are points well and
duly settled and accounted for, by ancient and modern physiologists.
A water-drinker, provided he is a profess'd one, and does it without fraud
or covin, is precisely in the same predicament: not that, at first sight,
there is any consequence, or show of logic in it, 'That a rill of cold
water dribbling through my inward parts, should light up a torch in my
Jenny's--'
--The proposition does not strike one; on the contrary, it seems to run
opposite to the natural workings of causes and effects--
But it shews the weakness and imbecility of human reason.
--'And in perfect good health with it?'
--The most perfect,--Madam, that friendship herself could wish me--
'And drink nothing!--nothing but water?'
--Impetuous fluid! the moment thou pressest against the flood-gates of the
brain--see how they give way!--
In swims Curiosity, beckoning to her damsels to follow--they dive into the
center of the current--
Fancy sits musing upon the bank, and with her eyes following the stream,
turns straws and bulrushes into masts and bow-sprits--And Desire, with vest
held up to the knee in one hand, snatches at them, as they swim by her,
with the other--
O ye water drinkers! is it then by this delusive fountain, that ye have so
often governed and turn'd this world about like a mill-wheel--grinding the
faces of the impotent--bepowdering their ribs--bepeppering their noses, and
changing sometimes even the very frame and face of nature--
If I was you, quoth Yorick, I would drink more water, Eugenius--And, if I
was you, Yorick, replied Eugenius, so would I.
Which shews they had both read Longinus--
For my own part, I am resolved never to read any book but my own, as long
as I live.
Chapter 4.XXX.
I wish my uncle Toby had been a water-drinker; for then the thing had been
accounted for, That the first moment Widow Wadman saw him, she felt
something stirring within her in his favour--Something!--something.
--Something perhaps more than friendship--less than love--something--no
matter what--no matter where--I would not give a single hair off my mule's
tail, and be obliged to pluck it off myself (indeed the villain has not
many to spare, and is not a little vicious into the bargain), to be let by
your worships into the secret--
But the truth is, my uncle Toby was not a water-drinker; he drank it
neither pure nor mix'd, or any how, or any where, except fortuitously upon
some advanced posts, where better liquor was not to be had--or during the
time he was under cure; when the surgeon telling him it would extend the
fibres, and bring them sooner into contact--my uncle Toby drank it for
quietness sake.
Now as all the world knows, that no effect in nature can be produced
without a cause, and as it is as well known, that my uncle Toby was neither
a weaver--a gardener, or a gladiator--unless as a captain, you will needs
have him one--but then he was only a captain of foot--and besides, the
whole is an equivocation--There is nothing left for us to suppose, but that
my uncle Toby's leg--but that will avail us little in the present
hypothesis, unless it had proceeded from some ailment in the foot--whereas
his leg was not emaciated from any disorder in his foot--for my uncle
Toby's leg was not emaciated at all. It was a little stiff and awkward,
from a total disuse of it, for the three years he lay confined at my
father's house in town; but it was plump and muscular, and in all other
respects as good and promising a leg as the other.
I declare, I do not recollect any one opinion or passage of my life, where
my understanding was more at a loss to make ends meet, and torture the
chapter I had been writing, to the service of the chapter following it,
than in the present case: one would think I took a pleasure in running
into difficulties of this kind, merely to make fresh experiments of getting
out of 'em--Inconsiderate soul that thou art! What! are not the
unavoidable distresses with which, as an author and a man, thou art hemm'd
in on every side of thee--are they, Tristram, not sufficient, but thou must
entangle thyself still more?
Is it not enough that thou art in debt, and that thou hast ten cart-loads
of thy fifth and sixth volumes (Alluding to the first edition.) still--
still unsold, and art almost at thy wit's ends, how to get them off thy
hands?
To this hour art thou not tormented with the vile asthma that thou gattest
in skating against the wind in Flanders? and is it but two months ago, that
in a fit of laughter, on seeing a cardinal make water like a quirister
(with both hands) thou brakest a vessel in thy lungs, whereby, in two
hours, thou lost as many quarts of blood; and hadst thou lost as much more,
did not the faculty tell thee--it would have amounted to a gallon?--
Chapter 4.XXXI.
--But for heaven's sake, let us not talk of quarts or gallons--let us take
the story straight before us; it is so nice and intricate a one, it will
scarce bear the transposition of a single tittle; and, somehow or other,
you have got me thrust almost into the middle of it--
--I beg we may take more care.
Chapter 4.XXXII.
My uncle Toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat and
precipitation, to take possession of the spot of ground we have so often
spoke of, in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the
allies; that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the
whole affair, it was neither a pioneer's spade, a pickax, or a shovel--
--It was a bed to lie on: so that as Shandy-Hall was at that time
unfurnished; and the little inn where poor Le Fever died, not yet built; my
uncle Toby was constrained to accept of a bed at Mrs. Wadman's, for a night
or two, till corporal Trim (who to the character of an excellent valet,
groom, cook, sempster, surgeon, and engineer, super-added that of an
excellent upholsterer too), with the help of a carpenter and a couple of
taylors, constructed one in my uncle Toby's house.
A daughter of Eve, for such was widow Wadman, and 'tis all the character I
intend to give of her--
--'That she was a perfect woman--' had better be fifty leagues off--or in
her warm bed--or playing with a case-knife--or any thing you please--than
make a man the object of her attention, when the house and all the
furniture is her own.
There is nothing in it out of doors and in broad day-light, where a woman
has a power, physically speaking, of viewing a man in more lights than one-
-but here, for her soul, she can see him in no light without mixing
something of her own goods and chattels along with him--till by reiterated
acts of such combination, he gets foisted into her inventory--
--And then good night.
But this is not matter of System; for I have delivered that above--nor is
it matter of Breviary--for I make no man's creed but my own--nor matter of
Fact--at least that I know of; but 'tis matter copulative and introductory
to what follows.
Chapter 4.XXXIII.
I do not speak it with regard to the coarseness or cleanness of them--or
the strength of their gussets--but pray do not night-shifts differ from
day-shifts as much in this particular, as in any thing else in the world;
that they so far exceed the others in length, that when you are laid down
in them, they fall almost as much below the feet, as the day-shifts fall
short of them?
Widow Wadman's night-shifts (as was the mode I suppose in King William's
and Queen Anne's reigns) were cut however after this fashion; and if the
fashion is changed (for in Italy they are come to nothing)--so much the
worse for the public; they were two Flemish ells and a half in length, so
that allowing a moderate woman two ells, she had half an ell to spare, to
do what she would with.
Now from one little indulgence gained after another, in the many bleak and
decemberley nights of a seven years widow-hood, things had insensibly come
to this pass, and for the two last years had got establish'd into one of
the ordinances of the bed-chamber--That as soon as Mrs. Wadman was put to
bed, and had got her legs stretched down to the bottom of it, of which she
always gave Bridget notice--Bridget, with all suitable decorum, having
first open'd the bed-clothes at the feet, took hold of the half-ell of
cloth we are speaking of, and having gently, and with both her hands, drawn
it downwards to its furthest extension, and then contracted it again side-
long by four or five even plaits, she took a large corking-pin out of her
sleeve, and with the point directed towards her, pinn'd the plaits all fast
together a little above the hem; which done, she tuck'd all in tight at the
feet, and wish'd her mistress a good night.
This was constant, and without any other variation than this; that on
shivering and tempestuous nights, when Bridget untuck'd the feet of the
bed, &c. to do this--she consulted no thermometer but that of her own
passions; and so performed it standing--kneeling--or squatting, according
to the different degrees of faith, hope, and charity, she was in, and bore
towards her mistress that night. In every other respect, the etiquette was
sacred, and might have vied with the most mechanical one of the most
inflexible bed-chamber in Christendom.
The first night, as soon as the corporal had conducted my uncle Toby up
stairs, which was about ten--Mrs. Wadman threw herself into her arm-chair,
and crossing her left knee with her right, which formed a resting-place for
her elbow, she reclin'd her cheek upon the palm of her hand, and leaning
forwards, ruminated till midnight upon both sides of the question.
The second night she went to her bureau, and having ordered Bridget to
bring her up a couple of fresh candles and leave them upon the table, she
took out her marriage-settlement, and read it over with great devotion: 
and the third night (which was the last of my uncle Toby's stay) when
Bridget had pull'd down the night-shift, and was assaying to stick in the
corking pin--
--With a kick of both heels at once, but at the same time the most natural
kick that could be kick'd in her situation--for supposing ......... to be
the sun in its meridian, it was a north-east kick--she kick'd the pin out
of her fingers--the etiquette which hung upon it, down--down it fell to the
ground, and was shiver'd into a thousand atoms.
From all which it was plain that widow Wadman was in love with my uncle
Toby.
Chapter 4.XXXIV.
My uncle Toby's head at that time was full of other matters, so that it was
not till the demolition of Dunkirk, when all the other civilities of Europe
were settled, that he found leisure to return this.
This made an armistice (that is, speaking with regard to my uncle Toby--but
with respect to Mrs. Wadman, a vacancy)--of almost eleven years. But in
all cases of this nature, as it is the second blow, happen at what distance
of time it will, which makes the fray--I chuse for that reason to call
these the amours of my uncle Toby with Mrs. Wadman, rather than the amours
of Mrs. Wadman with my uncle Toby.
This is not a distinction without a difference.
It is not like the affair of an old hat cock'd--and a cock'd old hat, about
which your reverences have so often been at odds with one another--but
there is a difference here in the nature of things--
And let me tell you, gentry, a wide one too.
Chapter 4.XXXV.
Now as widow Wadman did love my uncle Toby--and my uncle Toby did not love
widow Wadman, there was nothing for widow Wadman to do, but to go on and
love my uncle Toby--or let it alone.
Widow Wadman would do neither the one or the other.
--Gracious heaven!--but I forget I am a little of her temper myself; for
whenever it so falls out, which it sometimes does about the equinoxes, that
an earthly goddess is so much this, and that, and t'other, that I cannot
eat my breakfast for her--and that she careth not three halfpence whether I
eat my breakfast or no--
--Curse on her! and so I send her to Tartary, and from Tartary to Terra del
Fuogo, and so on to the devil: in short, there is not an infernal nitch
where I do not take her divinityship and stick it.
But as the heart is tender, and the passions in these tides ebb and flow
ten times in a minute, I instantly bring her back again; and as I do all
things in extremes, I place her in the very center of the milky-way--
Brightest of stars! thou wilt shed thy influence upon some one--
--The duce take her and her influence too--for at that word I lose all
patience--much good may it do him!--By all that is hirsute and gashly! I
cry, taking off my furr'd cap, and twisting it round my finger--I would not
give sixpence for a dozen such!
--But 'tis an excellent cap too (putting it upon my head, and pressing it
close to my ears)--and warm--and soft; especially if you stroke it the
right way--but alas! that will never be my luck--(so here my philosophy is
shipwreck'd again.)
--No; I shall never have a finger in the pye (so here I break my metaphor)-
-
Crust and Crumb
Inside and out
Top and bottom--I detest it, I hate it, I repudiate it--I'm sick at the
sight of it--
'Tis all pepper,
garlick,
staragen,
salt, and
devil's dung--by the great arch-cooks of cooks, who does nothing, I think,
from morning to night, but sit down by the fire-side and invent
inflammatory dishes for us, I would not touch it for the world--
--O Tristram! Tristram! cried Jenny.
O Jenny! Jenny! replied I, and so went on with the thirty-sixth chapter.
Chapter 4.XXXVI.
--'Not touch it for the world,' did I say--
Lord, how I have heated my imagination with this metaphor!
Chapter 4.XXXVII.
Which shews, let your reverences and worships say what you will of it (for
as for thinking--all who do think--think pretty much alike both upon it and
other matters)--Love is certainly, at least alphabetically speaking, one of
the most
A gitating
B ewitching
C onfounded
D evilish affairs of life--the most
E xtravagant
F utilitous
G alligaskinish
H andy-dandyish
I racundulous (there is no K to it) and
L yrical of all human passions: at the same time, the most
M isgiving
N innyhammering
O bstipating
P ragmatical
S tridulous
R idiculous--though by the bye the R should have gone first--But in short
'tis of such a nature, as my father once told my uncle Toby upon the close
of a long dissertation upon the subject--'You can scarce,' said he,
'combine two ideas together upon it, brother Toby, without an hypallage'--
What's that? cried my uncle Toby.
The cart before the horse, replied my father--
--And what is he to do there? cried my uncle Toby.
Nothing, quoth my father, but to get in--or let it alone.
Now widow Wadman, as I told you before, would do neither the one or the
other.
She stood however ready harnessed and caparisoned at all points, to watch
accidents.
Chapter 4.XXXVIII.
The Fates, who certainly all fore-knew of these amours of widow Wadman and
my uncle Toby, had, from the first creation of matter and motion (and with
more courtesy than they usually do things of this kind), established such a
chain of causes and effects hanging so fast to one another, that it was
scarce possible for my uncle Toby to have dwelt in any other house in the
world, or to have occupied any other garden in Christendom, but the very
house and garden which join'd and laid parallel to Mrs. Wadman's; this,
with the advantage of a thickset arbour in Mrs. Wadman's garden, but
planted in the hedge-row of my uncle Toby's, put all the occasions into her
hands which Love-militancy wanted; she could observe my uncle Toby's
motions, and was mistress likewise of his councils of war; and as his
unsuspecting heart had given leave to the corporal, through the mediation
of Bridget, to make her a wicker-gate of communication to enlarge her
walks, it enabled her to carry on her approaches to the very door of the
sentry-box; and sometimes out of gratitude, to make an attack, and
endeavour to blow my uncle Toby up in the very sentry-box itself.
Chapter 4.XXXIX.
It is a great pity--but 'tis certain from every day's observation of man,
that he may be set on fire like a candle, at either end--provided there is
a sufficient wick standing out; if there is not--there's an end of the
affair; and if there is--by lighting it at the bottom, as the flame in that
case has the misfortune generally to put out itself--there's an end of the
affair again.
For my part, could I always have the ordering of it which way I would be
burnt myself--for I cannot bear the thoughts of being burnt like a beast--I
would oblige a housewife constantly to light me at the top; for then I
should burn down decently to the socket; that is, from my head to my heart,
from my heart to my liver, from my liver to my bowels, and so on by the
meseraick veins and arteries, through all the turns and lateral insertions
of the intestines and their tunicles to the blind gut--
--I beseech you, doctor Slop, quoth my uncle Toby, interrupting him as he
mentioned the blind gut, in a discourse with my father the night my mother
was brought to bed of me--I beseech you, quoth my uncle Toby, to tell me
which is the blind gut; for, old as I am, I vow I do not know to this day
where it lies.
The blind gut, answered doctor Slop, lies betwixt the Ilion and Colon--
In a man? said my father.
--'Tis precisely the same, cried doctor Slop, in a woman.--
That's more than I know; quoth my father.
Chapter 4.XL.
--And so to make sure of both systems, Mrs. Wadman predetermined to light
my uncle Toby neither at this end or that; but, like a prodigal's candle,
to light him, if possible, at both ends at once.
Now, through all the lumber rooms of military furniture, including both of
horse and foot, from the great arsenal of Venice to the Tower of London
(exclusive), if Mrs. Wadman had been rummaging for seven years together,
and with Bridget to help her, she could not have found any one blind or
mantelet so fit for her purpose, as that which the expediency of my uncle
Toby's affairs had fix'd up ready to her hands.
I believe I have not told you--but I don't know--possibly I have--be it as
it will, 'tis one of the number of those many things, which a man had
better do over again, than dispute about it--That whatever town or fortress
the corporal was at work upon, during the course of their campaign, my
uncle Toby always took care, on the inside of his sentry-box, which was
towards his left hand, to have a plan of the place, fasten'd up with two or
three pins at the top, but loose at the bottom, for the conveniency of
holding it up to the eye, &c. . .as occasions required; so that when an
attack was resolved upon, Mrs. Wadman had nothing more to do, when she had
got advanced to the door of the sentry-box, but to extend her right hand;
and edging in her left foot at the same movement, to take hold of the map
or plan, or upright, or whatever it was, and with out-stretched neck
meeting it half way,--to advance it towards her; on which my uncle Toby's
passions were sure to catch fire--for he would instantly take hold of the
other corner of the map in his left hand, and with the end of his pipe in
the other, begin an explanation.
When the attack was advanced to this point;--the world will naturally enter
into the reasons of Mrs. Wadman's next stroke of generalship--which was, to
take my uncle Toby's tobacco-pipe out of his hand as soon as she possibly
could; which, under one pretence or other, but generally that of pointing
more distinctly at some redoubt or breastwork in the map, she would effect
before my uncle Toby (poor soul!) had well march'd above half a dozen
toises with it.
--It obliged my uncle Toby to make use of his forefinger.
The difference it made in the attack was this; That in going upon it, as in
the first case, with the end of her fore-finger against the end of my uncle
Toby's tobacco-pipe, she might have travelled with it, along the lines,
from Dan to Beersheba, had my uncle Toby's lines reach'd so far, without
any effect: For as there was no arterial or vital heat in the end of the
tobacco-pipe, it could excite no sentiment--it could neither give fire by
pulsation--or receive it by sympathy--'twas nothing but smoke.
Whereas, in following my uncle Toby's forefinger with hers, close thro' all
the little turns and indentings of his works--pressing sometimes against
the side of it--then treading upon its nail--then tripping it up--then
touching it here--then there, and so on--it set something at least in
motion.
This, tho' slight skirmishing, and at a distance from the main body, yet
drew on the rest; for here, the map usually falling with the back of it,
close to the side of the sentry-box, my uncle Toby, in the simplicity of
his soul, would lay his hand flat upon it, in order to go on with his
explanation; and Mrs. Wadman, by a manoeuvre as quick as thought, would as
certainly place her's close beside it; this at once opened a communication,
large enough for any sentiment to pass or re-pass, which a person skill'd
in the elementary and practical part of love-making, has occasion for--
By bringing up her forefinger parallel (as before) to my uncle Toby's--it
unavoidably brought the thumb into action--and the forefinger and thumb
being once engaged, as naturally brought in the whole hand. Thine, dear
uncle Toby! was never now in 'ts right place--Mrs. Wadman had it ever to
take up, or, with the gentlest pushings, protrusions, and equivocal
compressions, that a hand to be removed is capable of receiving--to get it
press'd a hair breadth of one side out of her way.
Whilst this was doing, how could she forget to make him sensible, that it
was her leg (and no one's else) at the bottom of the sentry-box, which
slightly press'd against the calf of his--So that my uncle Toby being thus
attack'd and sore push'd on both his wings--was it a wonder, if now and
then, it put his centre into disorder?--
--The duce take it! said my uncle Toby.
Chapter 4.XLI.
These attacks of Mrs. Wadman, you will readily conceive to be of different
kinds; varying from each other, like the attacks which history is full of,
and from the same reasons. A general looker-on would scarce allow them to
be attacks at all--or if he did, would confound them all together--but I
write not to them: it will be time enough to be a little more exact in my
descriptions of them, as I come up to them, which will not be for some
chapters; having nothing more to add in this, but that in a bundle of
original papers and drawings which my father took care to roll up by
themselves, there is a plan of Bouchain in perfect preservation (and shall
be kept so, whilst I have power to preserve any thing), upon the lower
corner of which, on the right hand side, there is still remaining the marks
of a snuffy finger and thumb, which there is all the reason in the world to
imagine, were Mrs. Wadman's; for the opposite side of the margin, which I
suppose to have been my uncle Toby's, is absolutely clean: This seems an
authenticated record of one of these attacks; for there are vestigia of the
two punctures partly grown up, but still visible on the opposite corner of
the map, which are unquestionably the very holes, through which it has been
pricked up in the sentry-box--
By all that is priestly! I value this precious relick, with its stigmata
and pricks, more than all the relicks of the Romish church--always
excepting, when I am writing upon these matters, the pricks which entered
the flesh of St. Radagunda in the desert, which in your road from Fesse to
Cluny, the nuns of that name will shew you for love.
Chapter 4.XLII.
I think, an' please your honour, quoth Trim, the fortifications are quite
destroyed--and the bason is upon a level with the mole--I think so too;
replied my uncle Toby with a sigh half suppress'd--but step into the
parlour, Trim, for the stipulation--it lies upon the table.
It has lain there these six weeks, replied the corporal, till this very
morning that the old woman kindled the fire with it--
--Then, said my uncle Toby, there is no further occasion for our services. 
The more, an' please your honour, the pity, said the corporal; in uttering
which he cast his spade into the wheel-barrow, which was beside him, with
an air the most expressive of disconsolation that can be imagined, and was
heavily turning about to look for his pickax, his pioneer's shovel, his
picquets, and other little military stores, in order to carry them off the
field--when a heigh-ho! from the sentry-box, which being made of thin slit
deal, reverberated the sound more sorrowfully to his ear, forbad him.
--No; said the corporal to himself, I'll do it before his honour rises to-
morrow morning; so taking his spade out of the wheel-barrow again, with a
little earth in it, as if to level something at the foot of the glacis--but
with a real intent to approach nearer to his master, in order to divert
him--he loosen'd a sod or two--pared their edges with his spade, and having
given them a gentle blow or two with the back of it, he sat himself down
close by my uncle Toby's feet and began as follows.
Chapter 4.XLIII.
It was a thousand pities--though I believe, an' please your honour, I am
going to say but a foolish kind of a thing for a soldier--
A soldier, cried my uncle Toby, interrupting the corporal, is no more
exempt from saying a foolish thing, Trim, than a man of letters--But not so
often, an' please your honour, replied the corporal--my uncle Toby gave a
nod.
It was a thousand pities then, said the corporal, casting his eye upon
Dunkirk, and the mole, as Servius Sulpicius, in returning out of Asia (when
he sailed from Aegina towards Megara), did upon Corinth and Pyreus--
--'It was a thousand pities, an' please your honour, to destroy these
works--and a thousand pities to have let them stood.'--
--Thou art right, Trim, in both cases; said my uncle Toby.--This, continued
the corporal, is the reason, that from the beginning of their demolition to
the end--I have never once whistled, or sung, or laugh'd, or cry'd, or
talk'd of past done deeds, or told your honour one story good or bad--
--Thou hast many excellencies, Trim, said my uncle Toby, and I hold it not
the least of them, as thou happenest to be a story-teller, that of the
number thou hast told me, either to amuse me in my painful hours, or divert
me in my grave ones--thou hast seldom told me a bad one--
--Because, an' please your honour, except one of a King of Bohemia and his
seven castles,--they are all true; for they are about myself--
I do not like the subject the worse, Trim, said my uncle Toby, on that
score: But prithee what is this story? thou hast excited my curiosity.
I'll tell it your honour, quoth the corporal, directly--Provided, said my
uncle Toby, looking earnestly towards Dunkirk and the mole again--provided
it is not a merry one; to such, Trim, a man should ever bring one half of
the entertainment along with him; and the disposition I am in at present
would wrong both thee, Trim, and thy story--It is not a merry one by any
means, replied the corporal--Nor would I have it altogether a grave one,
added my uncle Toby--It is neither the one nor the other, replied the
corporal, but will suit your honour exactly--Then I'll thank thee for it
with all my heart, cried my uncle Toby; so prithee begin it, Trim.
The corporal made his reverence; and though it is not so easy a matter as
the world imagines, to pull off a lank Montero-cap with grace--or a whit
less difficult, in my conceptions, when a man is sitting squat upon the
ground, to make a bow so teeming with respect as the corporal was wont; yet
by suffering the palm of his right hand, which was towards his master, to
slip backwards upon the grass, a little beyond his body, in order to allow
it the greater sweep--and by an unforced compression, at the same time, of
his cap with the thumb and the two forefingers of his left, by which the
diameter of the cap became reduced, so that it might be said, rather to be
insensibly squeez'd--than pull'd off with a flatus--the corporal acquitted
himself of both in a better manner than the posture of his affairs
promised; and having hemmed twice, to find in what key his story would best
go, and best suit his master's humour,--he exchanged a single look of
kindness with him, and set off thus.
The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles.
There was a certain king of Bo..he-
As the corporal was entering the confines of Bohemia, my uncle Toby obliged
him to halt for a single moment; he had set out bare-headed, having, since
he pull'd off his Montero-cap in the latter end of the last chapter, left
it lying beside him on the ground.
--The eye of Goodness espieth all things--so that before the corporal had
well got through the first five words of his story, had my uncle Toby twice
touch'd his Montero-cap with the end of his cane, interrogatively--as much
as to say, Why don't you put it on, Trim? Trim took it up with the most
respectful slowness, and casting a glance of humiliation as he did it, upon
the embroidery of the fore-part, which being dismally tarnish'd and fray'd
moreover in some of the principal leaves and boldest parts of the pattern,
he lay'd it down again between his two feet, in order to moralize upon the
subject.
--'Tis every word of it but too true, cried my uncle Toby, that thou art
about to observe--
'Nothing in this world, Trim, is made to last for ever.'
--But when tokens, dear Tom, of thy love and remembrance wear out, said
Trim, what shall we say?
There is no occasion, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, to say any thing else; and
was a man to puzzle his brains till Doom's day, I believe, Trim, it would
be impossible.
The corporal, perceiving my uncle Toby was in the right, and that it would
be in vain for the wit of man to think of extracting a purer moral from his
cap, without further attempting it, he put it on; and passing his hand
across his forehead to rub out a pensive wrinkle, which the text and the
doctrine between them had engender'd, he return'd, with the same look and
tone of voice, to his story of the king of Bohemia and his seven castles.
The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles, Continued.
There was a certain king of Bohemia, but in whose reign, except his own, I
am not able to inform your honour--
I do not desire it of thee, Trim, by any means, cried my uncle Toby.
--It was a little before the time, an' please your honour, when giants were
beginning to leave off breeding:--but in what year of our Lord that was--
I would not give a halfpenny to know, said my uncle Toby.
--Only, an' please your honour, it makes a story look the better in the
face--
--'Tis thy own, Trim, so ornament it after thy own fashion; and take any
date, continued my uncle Toby, looking pleasantly upon him--take any date
in the whole world thou chusest, and put it to--thou art heartily welcome--
The corporal bowed; for of every century, and of every year of that
century, from the first creation of the world down to Noah's flood; and
from Noah's flood to the birth of Abraham; through all the pilgrimages of
the patriarchs, to the departure of the Israelites out of Egypt--and
throughout all the Dynasties, Olympiads, Urbeconditas, and other memorable
epochas of the different nations of the world, down to the coming of
Christ, and from thence to the very moment in which the corporal was
telling his story--had my uncle Toby subjected this vast empire of time and
all its abysses at his feet; but as Modesty scarce touches with a finger
what Liberality offers her with both hands open--the corporal contented
himself with the very worst year of the whole bunch; which, to prevent your
honours of the Majority and Minority from tearing the very flesh off your
bones in contestation, 'Whether that year is not always the last cast-year
of the last cast-almanack'--I tell you plainly it was; but from a different
reason than you wot of--
--It was the year next him--which being the year of our Lord seventeen
hundred and twelve, when the Duke of Ormond was playing the devil in
Flanders--the corporal took it, and set out with it afresh on his
expedition to Bohemia.
The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles, Continued.
In the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and twelve, there was,
an' please your honour--
--To tell thee truly, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, any other date would have
pleased me much better, not only on account of the sad stain upon our
history that year, in marching off our troops, and refusing to cover the
siege of Quesnoi, though Fagel was carrying on the works with such
incredible vigour--but likewise on the score, Trim, of thy own story;
because if there are--and which, from what thou hast dropt, I partly
suspect to be the fact--if there are giants in it--
There is but one, an' please your honour--
--'Tis as bad as twenty, replied my uncle Toby--thou should'st have carried
him back some seven or eight hundred years out of harm's way, both of
critics and other people: and therefore I would advise thee, if ever thou
tellest it again--
--If I live, an' please your honour, but once to get through it, I will
never tell it again, quoth Trim, either to man, woman, or child--Poo--poo!
said my uncle Toby--but with accents of such sweet encouragement did he
utter it, that the corporal went on with his story with more alacrity than
ever.
The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles, Continued.
There was, an' please your honour, said the corporal, raising his voice and
rubbing the palms of his two hands cheerily together as he begun, a certain
king of Bohemia--
--Leave out the date entirely, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, leaning forwards,
and laying his hand gently upon the corporal's shoulder to temper the
interruption--leave it out entirely, Trim; a story passes very well without
these niceties, unless one is pretty sure of 'em--Sure of 'em! said the
corporal, shaking his head--
Right; answered my uncle Toby, it is not easy, Trim, for one, bred up as
thou and I have been to arms, who seldom looks further forward than to the
end of his musket, or backwards beyond his knapsack, to know much about
this matter--God bless your honour! said the corporal, won by the manner of
my uncle Toby's reasoning, as much as by the reasoning itself, he has
something else to do; if not on action, or a march, or upon duty in his
garrison--he has his firelock, an' please your honour, to furbish--his
accoutrements to take care of--his regimentals to mend--himself to shave
and keep clean, so as to appear always like what he is upon the parade;
what business, added the corporal triumphantly, has a soldier, an' please
your honour, to know any thing at all of geography?
--Thou would'st have said chronology, Trim, said my uncle Toby; for as for
geography, 'tis of absolute use to him; he must be acquainted intimately
with every country and its boundaries where his profession carries him; he
should know every town and city, and village and hamlet, with the canals,
the roads, and hollow ways which lead up to them; there is not a river or a
rivulet he passes, Trim, but he should be able at first sight to tell thee
what is its name--in what mountains it takes its rise--what is its course--
how far it is navigable--where fordable--where not; he should know the
fertility of every valley, as well as the hind who ploughs it; and be able
to describe, or, if it is required, to give thee an exact map of all the
plains and defiles, the forts, the acclivities, the woods and morasses,
thro' and by which his army is to march; he should know their produce,
their plants, their minerals, their waters, their animals, their seasons,
their climates, their heats and cold, their inhabitants, their customs,
their language, their policy, and even their religion.
Is it else to be conceived, corporal, continued my uncle Toby, rising up in
his sentry-box, as he began to warm in this part of his discourse--how
Marlborough could have marched his army from the banks of the Maes to
Belburg; from Belburg to Kerpenord--(here the corporal could sit no longer)
from Kerpenord, Trim, to Kalsaken; from Kalsaken to Newdorf; from Newdorf
to Landenbourg; from Landenbourg to Mildenheim; from Mildenheim to
Elchingen; from Elchingen to Gingen; from Gingen to Balmerchoffen; from
Balmerchoffen to Skellenburg, where he broke in upon the enemy's works;
forced his passage over the Danube; cross'd the Lech--push'd on his troops
into the heart of the empire, marching at the head of them through
Fribourg, Hokenwert, and Schonevelt, to the plains of Blenheim and
Hochstet?--Great as he was, corporal, he could not have advanced a step, or
made one single day's march without the aids of Geography.--As for
Chronology, I own, Trim, continued my uncle Toby, sitting down again coolly
in his sentry-box, that of all others, it seems a science which the soldier
might best spare, was it not for the lights which that science must one day
give him, in determining the invention of powder; the furious execution of
which, renversing every thing like thunder before it, has become a new aera
to us of military improvements, changing so totally the nature of attacks
and defences both by sea and land, and awakening so much art and skill in
doing it, that the world cannot be too exact in ascertaining the precise
time of its discovery, or too inquisitive in knowing what great man was the
discoverer, and what occasions gave birth to it.
I am far from controverting, continued my uncle Toby, what historians agree
in, that in the year of our Lord 1380, under the reign of Wencelaus, son of
Charles the Fourth--a certain priest, whose name was Schwartz, shew'd the
use of powder to the Venetians, in their wars against the Genoese; but 'tis
certain he was not the first; because if we are to believe Don Pedro, the
bishop of Leon--How came priests and bishops, an' please your honour, to
trouble their heads so much about gun-powder? God knows, said my uncle
Toby--his providence brings good out of every thing--and he avers, in his
chronicle of King Alphonsus, who reduced Toledo, That in the year 1343,
which was full thirty-seven years before that time, the secret of powder
was well known, and employed with success, both by Moors and Christians,
not only in their sea-combats, at that period, but in many of their most
memorable sieges in Spain and Barbary--And all the world knows, that Friar
Bacon had wrote expressly about it, and had generously given the world a
receipt to make it by, above a hundred and fifty years before even Schwartz
was born--And that the Chinese, added my uncle Toby, embarrass us, and all
accounts of it, still more, by boasting of the invention some hundreds of
years even before him--
They are a pack of liars, I believe, cried Trim--
--They are somehow or other deceived, said my uncle Toby, in this matter,
as is plain to me from the present miserable state of military architecture
amongst them; which consists of nothing more than a fosse with a brick wall
without flanks--and for what they gave us as a bastion at each angle of it,
'tis so barbarously constructed, that it looks for all the world--Like one
of my seven castles, an' please your honour, quoth Trim.
My uncle Toby, tho' in the utmost distress for a comparison, most
courteously refused Trim's offer--till Trim telling him, he had half a
dozen more in Bohemia, which he knew not how to get off his hands--my uncle
Toby was so touch'd with the pleasantry of heart of the corporal--that he
discontinued his dissertation upon gun-powder--and begged the corporal
forthwith to go on with his story of the King of Bohemia and his seven
castles.
The Story of the King of Bohemia and His Seven Castles, Continued.
This unfortunate King of Bohemia, said Trim,--Was he unfortunate, then?
cried my uncle Toby, for he had been so wrapt up in his dissertation upon
gun-powder, and other military affairs, that tho' he had desired the
corporal to go on, yet the many interruptions he had given, dwelt not so
strong upon his fancy as to account for the epithet--Was he unfortunate,
then, Trim? said my uncle Toby, pathetically--The corporal, wishing first
the word and all its synonimas at the devil, forthwith began to run back in
his mind, the principal events in the King of Bohemia's story; from every
one of which, it appearing that he was the most fortunate man that ever
existed in the world--it put the corporal to a stand: for not caring to
retract his epithet--and less to explain it--and least of all, to twist his
tale (like men of lore) to serve a system--he looked up in my uncle Toby's
face for assistance--but seeing it was the very thing my uncle Toby sat in
expectation of himself--after a hum and a haw, he went on--
The King of Bohemia, an' please your honour, replied the corporal, was
unfortunate, as thus--That taking great pleasure and delight in navigation
and all sort of sea affairs--and there happening throughout the whole
kingdom of Bohemia, to be no sea-port town whatever--
How the duce should there--Trim? cried my uncle Toby; for Bohemia being
totally inland, it could have happen'd no otherwise--It might, said Trim,
if it had pleased God--
My uncle Toby never spoke of the being and natural attributes of God, but
with diffidence and hesitation--
--I believe not, replied my uncle Toby, after some pause--for being inland,
as I said, and having Silesia and Moravia to the east; Lusatia and Upper
Saxony to the north; Franconia to the west; and Bavaria to the south;
Bohemia could not have been propell'd to the sea without ceasing to be
Bohemia--nor could the sea, on the other hand, have come up to Bohemia,
without overflowing a great part of Germany, and destroying millions of
unfortunate inhabitants who could make no defence against it--Scandalous!
cried Trim--Which would bespeak, added my uncle Toby, mildly, such a want
of compassion in him who is the father of it--that, I think, Trim--the
thing could have happen'd no way.
The corporal made the bow of unfeign'd conviction; and went on.
Now the King of Bohemia with his queen and courtiers happening one fine
summer's evening to walk out--Aye! there the word happening is right, Trim,
cried my uncle Toby; for the King of Bohemia and his queen might have
walk'd out or let it alone:--'twas a matter of contingency, which might
happen, or not, just as chance ordered it.
King William was of an opinion, an' please your honour, quoth Trim, that
every thing was predestined for us in this world; insomuch, that he would
often say to his soldiers, that 'every ball had its billet.' He was a
great man, said my uncle Toby--And I believe, continued Trim, to this day,
that the shot which disabled me at the battle of Landen, was pointed at my
knee for no other purpose, but to take me out of his service, and place me
in your honour's, where I should be taken so much better care of in my old
age--It shall never, Trim, be construed otherwise, said my uncle Toby.
The heart, both of the master and the man, were alike subject to sudden
over-flowings;--a short silence ensued.
Besides, said the corporal, resuming the discourse--but in a gayer accent--
if it had not been for that single shot, I had never, 'an please your
honour, been in love--
So, thou wast once in love, Trim! said my uncle Toby, smiling--
Souse! replied the corporal--over head and ears! an' please your honour. 
Prithee when? where?--and how came it to pass?--I never heard one word of
it before; quoth my uncle Toby:--I dare say, answered Trim, that every
drummer and serjeant's son in the regiment knew of it--It's high time I
should--said my uncle Toby.
Your honour remembers with concern, said the corporal, the total rout and
confusion of our camp and army at the affair of Landen; every one was left
to shift for himself; and if it had not been for the regiments of Wyndham,
Lumley, and Galway, which covered the retreat over the bridge Neerspeeken,
the king himself could scarce have gained it--he was press'd hard, as your
honour knows, on every side of him--
Gallant mortal! cried my uncle Toby, caught up with enthusiasm--this
moment, now that all is lost, I see him galloping across me, corporal, to
the left, to bring up the remains of the English horse along with him to
support the right, and tear the laurel from Luxembourg's brows, if yet 'tis
possible--I see him with the knot of his scarfe just shot off, infusing
fresh spirits into poor Galway's regiment--riding along the line--then
wheeling about, and charging Conti at the head of it--Brave, brave, by
heaven! cried my uncle Toby--he deserves a crown--As richly, as a thief a
halter; shouted Trim.
My uncle Toby knew the corporal's loyalty;--otherwise the comparison was
not at all to his mind--it did not altogether strike the corporal's fancy
when he had made it--but it could not be recall'd--so he had nothing to do,
but proceed.
As the number of wounded was prodigious, and no one had time to think of
any thing but his own safety--Though Talmash, said my uncle Toby, brought
off the foot with great prudence--But I was left upon the field, said the
corporal. Thou wast so; poor fellow! replied my uncle Toby--So that it was
noon the next day, continued the corporal, before I was exchanged, and put
into a cart with thirteen or fourteen more, in order to be convey'd to our
hospital.
There is no part of the body, an' please your honour, where a wound
occasions more intolerable anguish than upon the knee--
Except the groin; said my uncle Toby. An' please your honour, replied the
corporal, the knee, in my opinion, must certainly be the most acute, there
being so many tendons and what-d'ye-call-'ems all about it.
It is for that reason, quoth my uncle Toby, that the groin is infinitely
more sensible--there being not only as many tendons and what-d'ye-call-'ems
(for I know their names as little as thou dost)--about it--but moreover
...--
Mrs. Wadman, who had been all the time in her arbour--instantly stopp'd her
breath--unpinn'd her mob at the chin, and stood upon one leg--
The dispute was maintained with amicable and equal force betwixt my uncle
Toby and Trim for some time; till Trim at length recollecting that he had
often cried at his master's sufferings, but never shed a tear at his own--
was for giving up the point, which my uncle Toby would not allow--'Tis a
proof of nothing, Trim, said he, but the generosity of thy temper--
So that whether the pain of a wound in the groin (caeteris paribus) is
greater than the pain of a wound in the knee--or
Whether the pain of a wound in the knee is not greater than the pain of a
wound in the groin--are points which to this day remain unsettled.
Chapter 4.XLIV.
The anguish of my knee, continued the corporal, was excessive in itself;
and the uneasiness of the cart, with the roughness of the roads, which were
terribly cut up--making bad still worse--every step was death to me: so
that with the loss of blood, and the want of care-taking of me, and a fever
I felt coming on besides--(Poor soul! said my uncle Toby)--all together,
an' please your honour, was more than I could sustain.
I was telling my sufferings to a young woman at a peasant's house, where
our cart, which was the last of the line, had halted; they had help'd me
in, and the young woman had taken a cordial out of her pocket and dropp'd
it upon some sugar, and seeing it had cheer'd me, she had given it me a
second and a third time--So I was telling her, an' please your honour, the
anguish I was in, and was saying it was so intolerable to me, that I had
much rather lie down upon the bed, turning my face towards one which was in
the corner of the room--and die, than go on--when, upon her attempting to
lead me to it, I fainted away in her arms. She was a good soul! as your
honour, said the corporal, wiping his eyes, will hear.
I thought love had been a joyous thing, quoth my uncle Toby.
'Tis the most serious thing, an' please your honour (sometimes), that is in
the world.
By the persuasion of the young woman, continued the corporal, the cart with
the wounded men set off without me: she had assured them I should expire
immediately if I was put into the cart. So when I came to myself--I found
myself in a still quiet cottage, with no one but the young woman, and the
peasant and his wife. I was laid across the bed in the corner of the room,
with my wounded leg upon a chair, and the young woman beside me, holding
the corner of her handkerchief dipp'd in vinegar to my nose with one hand,
and rubbing my temples with the other.
I took her at first for the daughter of the peasant (for it was no inn)--so
had offer'd her a little purse with eighteen florins, which my poor brother
Tom (here Trim wip'd his eyes) had sent me as a token, by a recruit, just
before he set out for Lisbon--
--I never told your honour that piteous story yet--here Trim wiped his eyes
a third time.
The young woman call'd the old man and his wife into the room, to shew them
the money, in order to gain me credit for a bed and what little necessaries
I should want, till I should be in a condition to be got to the hospital--
Come then! said she, tying up the little purse--I'll be your banker--but as
that office alone will not keep me employ'd, I'll be your nurse too.
I thought by her manner of speaking this, as well as by her dress, which I
then began to consider more attentively--that the young woman could not be
the daughter of the peasant.
She was in black down to her toes, with her hair conceal'd under a cambric
border, laid close to her forehead: she was one of those kind of nuns, an'
please your honour, of which, your honour knows, there are a good many in
Flanders, which they let go loose--By thy description, Trim, said my uncle
Toby, I dare say she was a young Beguine, of which there are none to be
found any where but in the Spanish Netherlands--except at Amsterdam--they
differ from nuns in this, that they can quit their cloister if they choose
to marry; they visit and take care of the sick by profession--I had rather,
for my own part, they did it out of good-nature.
--She often told me, quoth Trim, she did it for the love of Christ--I did
not like it.--I believe, Trim, we are both wrong, said my uncle Toby--we'll
ask Mr. Yorick about it to-night at my brother Shandy's--so put me in mind;
added my uncle Toby.
The young Beguine, continued the corporal, had scarce given herself time to
tell me 'she would be my nurse,' when she hastily turned about to begin the
office of one, and prepare something for me--and in a short time--though I
thought it a long one--she came back with flannels, &c. &c. and having
fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours, &c. and made me a thin
bason of gruel for my supper--she wish'd me rest, and promised to be with
me early in the morning.--She wish'd me, an' please your honour, what was
not to be had. My fever ran very high that night--her figure made sad
disturbance within me--I was every moment cutting the world in two--to give
her half of it--and every moment was I crying, That I had nothing but a
knapsack and eighteen florins to share with her--The whole night long was
the fair Beguine, like an angel, close by my bed-side, holding back my
curtain and offering me cordials--and I was only awakened from my dream by
her coming there at the hour promised, and giving them in reality. In
truth, she was scarce ever from me; and so accustomed was I to receive life
from her hands, that my heart sickened, and I lost colour when she left the
room: and yet, continued the corporal (making one of the strangest
reflections upon it in the world)--
--'It was not love'--for during the three weeks she was almost constantly
with me, fomenting my knee with her hand, night and day--I can honestly
say, an' please your honour--that. . .once.
That was very odd, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby.
I think so too--said Mrs. Wadman.
It never did, said the corporal.

--But 'tis no marvel, continued the corporal--seeing my uncle Toby musing
upon it--for Love, an' please your honour, is exactly like war, in this;
that a soldier, though he has escaped three weeks complete o'Saturday
night,--may nevertheless be shot through his heart on Sunday morning--It
happened so here, an' please your honour, with this difference only--that
it was on Sunday in the afternoon, when I fell in love all at once with a
sisserara--It burst upon me, an' please your honour, like a bomb--scarce
giving me time to say, 'God bless me.'
I thought, Trim, said my uncle Toby, a man never fell in love so very
suddenly.
Yes, an' please your honour, if he is in the way of it--replied Trim.
I prithee, quoth my uncle Toby, inform me how this matter happened.
--With all pleasure, said the corporal, making a bow.
Chapter 4.XLVI.
I had escaped, continued the corporal, all that time from falling in love,
and had gone on to the end of the chapter, had it not been predestined
otherwise--there is no resisting our fate.
It was on a Sunday, in the afternoon, as I told your honour.
The old man and his wife had walked out--
Every thing was still and hush as midnight about the house--
There was not so much as a duck or a duckling about the yard--
--When the fair Beguine came in to see me.
My wound was then in a fair way of doing well--the inflammation had been
gone off for some time, but it was succeeded with an itching both above and
below my knee, so insufferable, that I had not shut my eyes the whole night
for it.
Let me see it, said she, kneeling down upon the ground parallel to my knee,
and laying her hand upon the part below it--it only wants rubbing a little,
said the Beguine; so covering it with the bed-clothes, she began with the
fore-finger of her right hand to rub under my knee, guiding her fore-finger
backwards and forwards by the edge of the flannel which kept on the
dressing.
In five or six minutes I felt slightly the end of her second finger--and
presently it was laid flat with the other, and she continued rubbing in
that way round and round for a good while; it then came into my head, that
I should fall in love--I blush'd when I saw how white a hand she had--I
shall never, an' please your honour, behold another hand so white whilst I
live--
--Not in that place, said my uncle Toby--
Though it was the most serious despair in nature to the corporal--he could
not forbear smiling.
The young Beguine, continued the corporal, perceiving it was of great
service to me--from rubbing for some time, with two fingers--proceeded to
rub at length, with three--till by little and little she brought down the
fourth, and then rubb'd with her whole hand: I will never say another
word, an' please your honour, upon hands again--but it was softer than
sattin--
--Prithee, Trim, commend it as much as thou wilt, said my uncle Toby; I
shall hear thy story with the more delight--The corporal thank'd his master
most unfeignedly; but having nothing to say upon the Beguine's hand but the
same over again--he proceeded to the effects of it.
The fair Beguine, said the corporal, continued rubbing with her whole hand
under my knee--till I fear'd her zeal would weary her--'I would do a
thousand times more,' said she, 'for the love of Christ'--In saying which,
she pass'd her hand across the flannel, to the part above my knee, which I
had equally complain'd of, and rubb'd it also.
I perceiv'd, then, I was beginning to be in love--
As she continued rub-rub-rubbing--I felt it spread from under her hand, an'
please your honour, to every part of my frame--
The more she rubb'd, and the longer strokes she took--the more the fire
kindled in my veins--till at length, by two or three strokes longer than
the rest--my passion rose to the highest pitch--I seiz'd her hand--
--And then thou clapped'st it to thy lips, Trim, said my uncle Toby--and
madest a speech.
Whether the corporal's amour terminated precisely in the way my uncle Toby
described it, is not material; it is enough that it contained in it the
essence of all the love romances which ever have been wrote since the
beginning of the world.
Chapter 4.XLVII.
As soon as the corporal had finished the story of his amour--or rather my
uncle Toby for him--Mrs. Wadman silently sallied forth from her arbour,
replaced the pin in her mob, pass'd the wicker gate, and advanced slowly
towards my uncle Toby's sentry-box: the disposition which Trim had made in
my uncle Toby's mind, was too favourable a crisis to be let slipp'd--
--The attack was determin'd upon: it was facilitated still more by my
uncle Toby's having ordered the corporal to wheel off the pioneer's shovel,
the spade, the pick-axe, the picquets, and other military stores which lay
scatter'd upon the ground where Dunkirk stood--The corporal had march'd--
the field was clear.
Now, consider, sir, what nonsense it is, either in fighting, or writing, or
any thing else (whether in rhyme to it, or not) which a man has occasion to
do--to act by plan: for if ever Plan, independent of all circumstances,
deserved registering in letters of gold (I mean in the archives of Gotham)-
-it was certainly the Plan of Mrs. Wadman's attack of my uncle Toby in his
sentry-box, By Plan--Now the plan hanging up in it at this juncture, being
the Plan of Dunkirk--and the tale of Dunkirk a tale of relaxation, it
opposed every impression she could make: and besides, could she have gone
upon it--the manoeuvre of fingers and hands in the attack of the sentry-
box, was so outdone by that of the fair Beguine's, in Trim's story--that
just then, that particular attack, however successful before--became the
most heartless attack that could be made--
O! let woman alone for this. Mrs. Wadman had scarce open'd the wicker-
gate, when her genius sported with the change of circumstances.
--She formed a new attack in a moment.
Chapter 4.XLVIII.
--I am half distracted, captain Shandy, said Mrs. Wadman, holding up her
cambrick handkerchief to her left eye, as she approach'd the door of my
uncle Toby's sentry-box--a mote--or sand--or something--I know not what,
has got into this eye of mine--do look into it--it is not in the white--
In saying which, Mrs. Wadman edged herself close in beside my uncle Toby,
and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his bench, she gave him an
opportunity of doing it without rising up--Do look into it--said she.
Honest soul! thou didst look into it with as much innocency of heart, as
ever child look'd into a raree-shew-box; and 'twere as much a sin to have
hurt thee.
--If a man will be peeping of his own accord into things of that nature--
I've nothing to say to it--
My uncle Toby never did: and I will answer for him, that he would have sat
quietly upon a sofa from June to January (which, you know, takes in both
the hot and cold months), with an eye as fine as the Thracian Rodope's
(Rodope Thracia tam inevitabili fascino instructa, tam exacte oculus
intuens attraxit, ut si in illam quis incidisset, fieri non posset, quin
caperetur.--I know not who.) besides him, without being able to tell,
whether it was a black or blue one.
The difficulty was to get my uncle Toby, to look at one at all.
'Tis surmounted. And
I see him yonder with his pipe pendulous in his hand, and the ashes falling
out of it--looking--and looking--then rubbing his eyes--and looking again,
with twice the good-nature that ever Galileo look'd for a spot in the sun.
--In vain! for by all the powers which animate the organ--Widow Wadman's
left eye shines this moment as lucid as her right--there is neither mote,
or sand, or dust, or chaff, or speck, or particle of opake matter floating
in it--There is nothing, my dear paternal uncle! but one lambent delicious
fire, furtively shooting out from every part of it, in all directions, into
thine--
--If thou lookest, uncle Toby, in search of this mote one moment longer,--
thou art undone.
Chapter 4.XLIX.
An eye is for all the world exactly like a cannon, in this respect; That it
is not so much the eye or the cannon, in themselves, as it is the carriage
of the eye--and the carriage of the cannon, by which both the one and the
other are enabled to do so much execution. I don't think the comparison a
bad one: However, as 'tis made and placed at the head of the chapter, as
much for use as ornament, all I desire in return, is, that whenever I speak
of Mrs. Wadman's eyes (except once in the next period), that you keep it in
your fancy.
I protest, Madam, said my uncle Toby, I can see nothing whatever in your
eye.
It is not in the white; said Mrs. Wadman: my uncle Toby look'd with might
and main into the pupil--
Now of all the eyes which ever were created--from your own, Madam, up to
those of Venus herself, which certainly were as venereal a pair of eyes as
ever stood in a head--there never was an eye of them all, so fitted to rob
my uncle Toby of his repose, as the very eye, at which he was looking--it
was not, Madam a rolling eye--a romping or a wanton one--nor was it an eye
sparkling--petulant or imperious--of high claims and terrifying exactions,
which would have curdled at once that milk of human nature, of which my
uncle Toby was made up--but 'twas an eye full of gentle salutations--and
soft responses--speaking--not like the trumpet stop of some ill-made organ,
in which many an eye I talk to, holds coarse converse--but whispering soft-
-like the last low accent of an expiring saint--'How can you live
comfortless, captain Shandy, and alone, without a bosom to lean your head
on--or trust your cares to?'
It was an eye--
But I shall be in love with it myself, if I say another word about it.
--It did my uncle Toby's business.
Chapter 4.L.
There is nothing shews the character of my father and my uncle Toby, in a
more entertaining light, than their different manner of deportment, under
the same accident--for I call not love a misfortune, from a persuasion,
that a man's heart is ever the better for it--Great God! what must my uncle
Toby's have been, when 'twas all benignity without it.
My father, as appears from many of his papers, was very subject to this
passion, before he married--but from a little subacid kind of drollish
impatience in his nature, whenever it befell him, he would never submit to
it like a christian; but would pish, and huff, and bounce, and kick, and
play the Devil, and write the bitterest Philippicks against the eye that
ever man wrote--there is one in verse upon somebody's eye or other, that
for two or three nights together, had put him by his rest; which in his
first transport of resentment against it, he begins thus:
'A Devil 'tis--and mischief such doth work
As never yet did Pagan, Jew, or Turk.'
(This will be printed with my father's Life of Socrates, &c. &c.)
In short, during the whole paroxism, my father was all abuse and foul
language, approaching rather towards malediction--only he did not do it
with as much method as Ernulphus--he was too impetuous; nor with
Ernulphus's policy--for tho' my father, with the most intolerant spirit,
would curse both this and that, and every thing under heaven, which was
either aiding or abetting to his love--yet never concluded his chapter of
curses upon it, without cursing himself in at the bargain, as one of the
most egregious fools and cox-combs, he would say, that ever was let loose
in the world.
My uncle Toby, on the contrary, took it like a lamb--sat still and let the
poison work in his veins without resistance--in the sharpest exacerbations
of his wound (like that on his groin) he never dropt one fretful or
discontented word--he blamed neither heaven nor earth--or thought or spoke
an injurious thing of any body, or any part of it; he sat solitary and
pensive with his pipe--looking at his lame leg--then whiffing out a
sentimental heigh ho! which mixing with the smoke, incommoded no one
mortal.
He took it like a lamb--I say.
In truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride with my
father, that very morning, to save if possible a beautiful wood, which the
dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the poor (Mr. Shandy must mean
the poor in spirit; inasmuch as they divided the money amongst
themselves.); which said wood being in full view of my uncle Toby's house,
and of singular service to him in his description of the battle of
Wynnendale--by trotting on too hastily to save it--upon an uneasy saddle--
worse horse, &c. &c. . .it had so happened, that the serous part of the
blood had got betwixt the two skins, in the nethermost part of my uncle
Toby--the first shootings of which (as my uncle Toby had no experience of
love) he had taken for a part of the passion--till the blister breaking in
the one case--and the other remaining--my uncle Toby was presently
convinced, that his wound was not a skin-deep wound--but that it had gone
to his heart.
Chapter 4.LI.
The world is ashamed of being virtuous--my uncle Toby knew little of the
world; and therefore when he felt he was in love with widow Wadman, he had
no conception that the thing was any more to be made a mystery of, than if
Mrs. Wadman had given him a cut with a gap'd knife across his finger: Had
it been otherwise--yet as he ever look'd upon Trim as a humble friend; and
saw fresh reasons every day of his life, to treat him as such--it would
have made no variation in the manner in which he informed him of the
affair.
'I am in love, corporal!' quoth my uncle Toby.
Chapter 4.LII.
In love!--said the corporal--your honour was very well the day before
yesterday, when I was telling your honour of the story of the King of
Bohemia--Bohemia! said my uncle Toby. . .musing a long time. . .What became
of that story, Trim?
--We lost it, an' please your honour, somehow betwixt us--but your honour
was as free from love then, as I am--'twas just whilst thou went'st off
with the wheel-barrow--with Mrs. Wadman, quoth my uncle Toby--She has left
a ball here--added my uncle Toby--pointing to his breast--
--She can no more, an' please your honour, stand a siege, than she can fly-
-cried the corporal--
--But as we are neighbours, Trim,--the best way I think is to let her know
it civilly first--quoth my uncle Toby.
Now if I might presume, said the corporal, to differ from your honour--
--Why else do I talk to thee, Trim? said my uncle Toby, mildly--
--Then I would begin, an' please your honour, with making a good thundering
attack upon her, in return--and telling her civilly afterwards--for if she
knows any thing of your honour's being in love, before hand--L..d help
her!--she knows no more at present of it, Trim, said my uncle Toby--than
the child unborn--
Precious souls!--
Mrs. Wadman had told it, with all its circumstances, to Mrs. Bridget
twenty-four hours before; and was at that very moment sitting in council
with her, touching some slight misgivings with regard to the issue of the
affairs, which the Devil, who never lies dead in a ditch, had put into her
head--before he would allow half time, to get quietly through her Te Deum.
I am terribly afraid, said widow Wadman, in case I should marry him,
Bridget--that the poor captain will not enjoy his health, with the
monstrous wound upon his groin--
It may not, Madam, be so very large, replied Bridget, as you think--and I
believe, besides, added she--that 'tis dried up--
--I could like to know--merely for his sake, said Mrs. Wadman--
--We'll know and long and the broad of it, in ten days--answered Mrs.
Bridget, for whilst the captain is paying his addresses to you--I'm
confident Mr. Trim will be for making love to me--and I'll let him as much
as he will--added Bridget--to get it all out of him--
The measures were taken at once--and my uncle Toby and the corporal went on
with theirs.
Now, quoth the corporal, setting his left hand a-kimbo, and giving such a
flourish with his right, as just promised success--and no more--if your
honour will give me leave to lay down the plan of this attack--
--Thou wilt please me by it, Trim, said my uncle Toby, exceedingly--and as
I foresee thou must act in it as my aid de camp, here's a crown, corporal,
to begin with, to steep thy commission.
Then, an' please your honour, said the corporal (making a bow first for his
commission)--we will begin with getting your honour's laced clothes out of
the great campaign-trunk, to be well air'd, and have the blue and gold
taken up at the sleeves--and I'll put your white ramallie-wig fresh into
pipes--and send for a taylor, to have your honour's thin scarlet breeches
turn'd--
--I had better take the red plush ones, quoth my uncle Toby--They will be
too clumsy--said the corporal.
Chapter 4.LIII.
--Thou wilt get a brush and a little chalk to my sword--'Twill be only in
your honour's way, replied Trim.
Chapter 4.LIV.
--But your honour's two razors shall be new set--and I will get my Montero
cap furbish'd up, and put on poor lieutenant Le Fever's regimental coat,
which your honour gave me to wear for his sake--and as soon as your honour
is clean shaved--and has got your clean shirt on, with your blue and gold,
or your fine scarlet--sometimes one and sometimes t'other--and every thing
is ready for the attack--we'll march up boldly, as if 'twas to the face of
a bastion; and whilst your honour engages Mrs. Wadman in the parlour, to
the right--I'll attack Mrs. Bridget in the kitchen, to the left; and having
seiz'd the pass, I'll answer for it, said the corporal, snapping his
fingers over his head--that the day is our own.
I wish I may but manage it right; said my uncle Toby--but I declare,
corporal, I had rather march up to the very edge of a trench--
--A woman is quite a different thing--said the corporal.
--I suppose so, quoth my uncle Toby.
Chapter 4.LV.
If any thing in this world, which my father said, could have provoked my
uncle Toby, during the time he was in love, it was the perverse use my
father was always making of an expression of Hilarion the hermit; who, in
speaking of his abstinence, his watchings, flagellations, and other
instrumental parts of his religion--would say--tho' with more facetiousness
than became an hermit--'That they were the means he used, to make his ass
(meaning his body) leave off kicking.'
It pleased my father well; it was not only a laconick way of expressing--
but of libelling, at the same time, the desires and appetites of the lower
part of us; so that for many years of my father's life, 'twas his constant
mode of expression--he never used the word passions once--but ass always
instead of them--So that he might be said truly, to have been upon the
bones, or the back of his own ass, or else of some other man's, during all
that time.
I must here observe to you the difference betwixt
My father's ass
and my hobby-horse--in order to keep characters as separate as may be, in
our fancies as we go along.
For my hobby-horse, if you recollect a little, is no way a vicious beast;
he has scarce one hair or lineament of the ass about him--'Tis the sporting
little filly-folly which carries you out for the present hour--a maggot, a
butterfly, a picture, a fiddlestick--an uncle Toby's siege--or an any
thing, which a man makes a shift to get a-stride on, to canter it away from
the cares and solicitudes of life--'Tis as useful a beast as is in the
whole creation--nor do I really see how the world could do without it--
--But for my father's ass--oh! mount him--mount him--mount him--(that's
three times, is it not?)--mount him not:--'tis a beast concupiscent--and
foul befal the man, who does not hinder him from kicking.
Chapter 4.LVI.
Well! dear brother Toby, said my father, upon his first seeing him after he
fell in love--and how goes it with your Asse?
Now my uncle Toby thinking more of the part where he had had the blister,
than of Hilarion's metaphor--and our preconceptions having (you know) as
great a power over the sounds of words as the shapes of things, he had
imagined, that my father, who was not very ceremonious in his choice of
words, had enquired after the part by its proper name: so notwithstanding
my mother, doctor Slop, and Mr. Yorick, were sitting in the parlour, he
thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father had made use of
than not. When a man is hemm'd in by two indecorums, and must commit one
of 'em--I always observe--let him chuse which he will, the world will blame
him--so I should not be astonished if it blames my uncle Toby.
My A..e, quoth my uncle Toby, is much better--brother Shandy--My father had
formed great expectations from his Asse in this onset; and would have
brought him on again; but doctor Slop setting up an intemperate laugh--and
my mother crying out L... bless us!--it drove my father's Asse off the
field--and the laugh then becoming general--there was no bringing him back
to the charge, for some time--
And so the discourse went on without him.
Every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother Toby,--and we
hope it is true.
I am as much in love, sister, I believe, replied my uncle Toby, as any man
usually is--Humph! said my father--and when did you know it? quoth my
mother--
--When the blister broke; replied my uncle Toby.
My uncle Toby's reply put my father into good temper--so he charg'd o'
foot.
Chapter 4.LVII.
As the ancients agree, brother Toby, said my father, that there are two
different and distinct kinds of love, according to the different parts
which are affected by it--the Brain or Liver--I think when a man is in
love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen
into.
What signifies it, brother Shandy, replied my uncle Toby, which of the two
it is, provided it will but make a man marry, and love his wife, and get a
few children?
--A few children! cried my father, rising out of his chair, and looking
full in my mother's face, as he forced his way betwixt her's and doctor
Slop's--a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle Toby's words as
he walk'd to and fro--
--Not, my dear brother Toby, cried my father, recovering himself all at
once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle Toby's chair--not that I
should be sorry hadst thou a score--on the contrary, I should rejoice--and
be as kind, Toby, to every one of them as a father--
My uncle Toby stole his hand unperceived behind his chair, to give my
father's a squeeze--
--Nay, moreover, continued he, keeping hold of my uncle Toby's hand--so
much dost thou possess, my dear Toby, of the milk of human nature, and so
little of its asperities--'tis piteous the world is not peopled by
creatures which resemble thee; and was I an Asiatic monarch, added my
father, heating himself with his new project--I would oblige thee, provided
it would not impair thy strength--or dry up thy radical moisture too fast--
or weaken thy memory or fancy, brother Toby, which these gymnics
inordinately taken are apt to do--else, dear Toby, I would procure thee the
most beautiful woman in my empire, and I would oblige thee, nolens, volens,
to beget for me one subject every month--
As my father pronounced the last word of the sentence--my mother took a
pinch of snuff.
Now I would not, quoth my uncle Toby, get a child, nolens, volens, that is,
whether I would or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth--
--And 'twould be cruel in me, brother Toby, to compel thee; said my father-
-but 'tis a case put to shew thee, that it is not thy begetting a child--in
case thou should'st be able--but the system of Love and Marriage thou goest
upon, which I would set thee right in--
There is at least, said Yorick, a great deal of reason and plain sense in
captain Shandy's opinion of love; and 'tis amongst the ill-spent hours of
my life, which I have to answer for, that I have read so many flourishing
poets and rhetoricians in my time, from whom I never could extract so much-
-
I wish, Yorick, said my father, you had read Plato; for there you would
have learnt that there are two Loves--I know there were two Religions,
replied Yorick, amongst the ancients--one--for the vulgar, and another for
the learned;--but I think One Love might have served both of them very
well--
I could not; replied my father--and for the same reasons: for of these
Loves, according to Ficinus's comment upon Velasius, the one is rational--
--the other is natural--the first ancient--without mother--where Venus had
nothing to do: the second, begotten of Jupiter and Dione--
--Pray, brother, quoth my uncle Toby, what has a man who believes in God to
do with this? My father could not stop to answer, for fear of breaking the
thread of his discourse--
This latter, continued he, partakes wholly of the nature of Venus.
The first, which is the golden chain let down from heaven, excites to love
heroic, which comprehends in it, and excites to the desire of philosophy
and truth--the second, excites to desire, simply--
--I think the procreation of children as beneficial to the world, said
Yorick, as the finding out the longitude--
--To be sure, said my mother, love keeps peace in the world--
--In the house--my dear, I own--
--It replenishes the earth; said my mother--
But it keeps heaven empty--my dear; replied my father.
--'Tis Virginity, cried Slop, triumphantly, which fills paradise.
Well push'd nun! quoth my father.
Chapter 4.LVIII.
My father had such a skirmishing, cutting kind of a slashing way with him
in his disputations, thrusting and ripping, and giving every one a stroke
to remember him by in his turn--that if there were twenty people in
company--in less than half an hour he was sure to have every one of 'em
against him.
What did not a little contribute to leave him thus without an ally, was,
that if there was any one post more untenable than the rest, he would be
sure to throw himself into it; and to do him justice, when he was once
there, he would defend it so gallantly, that 'twould have been a concern,
either to a brave man or a good-natured one, to have seen him driven out.
Yorick, for this reason, though he would often attack him--yet could never
bear to do it with all his force.
Doctor Slop's Virginity, in the close of the last chapter, had got him for
once on the right side of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow up all
the convents in Christendom about Slop's ears, when corporal Trim came into
the parlour to inform my uncle Toby, that his thin scarlet breeches, in
which the attack was to be made upon Mrs. Wadman, would not do; for that
the taylor, in ripping them up, in order to turn them, had found they had
been turn'd before--Then turn them again, brother, said my father, rapidly,
for there will be many a turning of 'em yet before all's done in the
affair--They are as rotten as dirt, said the corporal--Then by all means,
said my father, bespeak a new pair, brother--for though I know, continued
my father, turning himself to the company, that widow Wadman has been
deeply in love with my brother Toby for many years, and has used every art
and circumvention of woman to outwit him into the same passion, yet now
that she has caught him--her fever will be pass'd its height--
--She has gained her point.
In this case, continued my father, which Plato, I am persuaded, never
thought of--Love, you see, is not so much a Sentiment as a Situation, into
which a man enters, as my brother Toby would do, into a corps--no matter
whether he loves the service or no--being once in it--he acts as if he did;
and takes every step to shew himself a man of prowesse.
The hypothesis, like the rest of my father's, was plausible enough, and my
uncle Toby had but a single word to object to it--in which Trim stood ready
to second him--but my father had not drawn his conclusion--
For this reason, continued my father (stating the case over again)--
notwithstanding all the world knows, that Mrs. Wadman affects my brother
Toby--and my brother Toby contrariwise affects Mrs. Wadman, and no obstacle
in nature to forbid the music striking up this very night, yet will I
answer for it, that this self-same tune will not be play'd this
twelvemonth.
We have taken our measures badly, quoth my uncle Toby, looking up
interrogatively in Trim's face.
I would lay my Montero-cap, said Trim--Now Trim's Montero-cap, as I once
told you, was his constant wager; and having furbish'd it up that very
night, in order to go upon the attack--it made the odds look more
considerable--I would lay, an' please your honour, my Montero-cap to a
shilling--was it proper, continued Trim (making a bow), to offer a wager
before your honours--
--There is nothing improper in it, said my father--'tis a mode of
expression; for in saying thou would'st lay thy Montero-cap to a shilling--
all thou meanest is this--that thou believest--
--Now, What do'st thou believe?
That widow Wadman, an' please your worship, cannot hold it out ten days--
And whence, cried Slop, jeeringly, hast thou all this knowledge of woman,
friend?
By falling in love with a popish clergy-woman; said Trim.
'Twas a Beguine, said my uncle Toby.
Doctor Slop was too much in wrath to listen to the distinction; and my
father taking that very crisis to fall in helter-skelter upon the whole
order of Nuns and Beguines, a set of silly, fusty, baggages--Slop could not
stand it--and my uncle Toby having some measures to take about his
breeches--and Yorick about his fourth general division--in order for their
several attacks next day--the company broke up: and my father being left
alone, and having half an hour upon his hands betwixt that and bed-time; he
called for pen, ink, and paper, and wrote my uncle Toby the following
letter of instructions: 
My dear brother Toby,
What I am going to say to thee is upon the nature of women, and of love-
making to them; and perhaps it is as well for thee--tho' not so well for
me--that thou hast occasion for a letter of instructions upon that head,
and that I am able to write it to thee.
Had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots--and thou no
sufferer by the knowledge, I had been well content that thou should'st have
dipp'd the pen this moment into the ink, instead of myself; but that not
being the case--Mrs. Shandy being now close beside me, preparing for bed--I
have thrown together without order, and just as they have come into my
mind, such hints and documents as I deem may be of use to thee; intending,
in this, to give thee a token of my love; not doubting, my dear Toby, of
the manner in which it will be accepted.
In the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion in the
affair--though I perceive from a glow in my cheek, that I blush as I begin
to speak to thee upon the subject, as well knowing, notwithstanding thy
unaffected secrecy, how few of its offices thou neglectest--yet I would
remind thee of one (during the continuance of thy courtship) in a
particular manner, which I would not have omitted; and that is, never to go
forth upon the enterprize, whether it be in the morning or the afternoon,
without first recommending thyself to the protection of Almighty God, that
he may defend thee from the evil one.
Shave the whole top of thy crown clean once at least every four or five
days, but oftner if convenient; lest in taking off thy wig before her,
thro' absence of mind, she should be able to discover how much has been cut
away by Time--how much by Trim.
--'Twere better to keep ideas of baldness out of her fancy.
Always carry it in thy mind, and act upon it as a sure maxim, Toby--
'That women are timid:' And 'tis well they are--else there would be no
dealing with them.
Let not thy breeches be too tight, or hang too loose about thy thighs, like
the trunk-hose of our ancestors.
--A just medium prevents all conclusions.
Whatever thou hast to say, be it more or less, forget not to utter it in a
low soft tone of voice. Silence, and whatever approaches it, weaves dreams
of midnight secrecy into the brain: For this cause, if thou canst help it,
never throw down the tongs and poker.
Avoid all kinds of pleasantry and facetiousness in thy discourse with her,
and do whatever lies in thy power at the same time, to keep her from all
books and writings which tend thereto: there are some devotional tracts,
which if thou canst entice her to read over--it will be well: but suffer
her not to look into Rabelais, or Scarron, or Don Quixote--
--They are all books which excite laughter; and thou knowest, dear Toby,
that there is no passion so serious as lust.
Stick a pin in the bosom of thy shirt, before thou enterest her parlour.
And if thou art permitted to sit upon the same sopha with her, and she
gives thee occasion to lay thy hand upon hers--beware of taking it--thou
canst not lay thy hand on hers, but she will feel the temper of thine. 
Leave that and as many other things as thou canst, quite undetermined; by
so doing, thou wilt have her curiosity on thy side; and if she is not
conquered by that, and thy Asse continues still kicking, which there is
great reason to suppose--Thou must begin, with first losing a few ounces of
blood below the ears, according to the practice of the ancient Scythians,
who cured the most intemperate fits of the appetite by that means.
Avicenna, after this, is for having the part anointed with the syrup of
hellebore, using proper evacuations and purges--and I believe rightly. But
thou must eat little or no goat's flesh, nor red deer--nor even foal's
flesh by any means; and carefully abstain--that is, as much as thou canst,
from peacocks, cranes, coots, didappers, and water-hens--
As for thy drink--I need not tell thee, it must be the infusion of Vervain
and the herb Hanea, of which Aelian relates such effects--but if thy
stomach palls with it--discontinue it from time to time, taking cucumbers,
melons, purslane, water-lillies, woodbine, and lettice, in the stead of
them.
There is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at present--
--Unless the breaking out of a fresh war--So wishing every thing, dear
Toby, for best,
I rest thy affectionate brother,
Walter Shandy.
Chapter 4.LIX.
Whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions, my uncle Toby and
the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack. As the
turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside (at least for the
present), there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next
morning; so accordingly it was resolv'd upon, for eleven o'clock.
Come, my dear, said my father to my mother--'twill be but like a brother
and sister, if you and I take a walk down to my brother Toby's--to
countenance him in this attack of his.
My uncle Toby and the corporal had been accoutred both some time, when my
father and mother enter'd, and the clock striking eleven, were that moment
in motion to sally forth--but the account of this is worth more than to be
wove into the fag end of the eighth (Alluding to the first edition.) volume
of such a work as this.--My father had no time but to put the letter of
instructions into my uncle Toby's coat-pocket--and join with my mother in
wishing his attack prosperous.
I could like, said my mother, to look through the key-hole out of
curiosity--Call it by its right name, my dear, quoth my father--
And look through the key-hole as long as you will.
Chapter 4.LX.
I call all the powers of time and chance, which severally check us in our
careers in this world, to bear me witness, that I could never yet get
fairly to my uncle Toby's amours, till this very moment, that my mother's
curiosity, as she stated the affair,--or a different impulse in her, as my
father would have it--wished her to take a peep at them through the key-
hole.
'Call it, my dear, by its right name, quoth my father, and look through the
key-hole as long as you will.'
Nothing but the fermentation of that little subacid humour, which I have
often spoken of, in my father's habit, could have vented such an
insinuation--he was however frank and generous in his nature, and at all
times open to conviction; so that he had scarce got to the last word of
this ungracious retort, when his conscience smote him.
My mother was then conjugally swinging with her left arm twisted under his
right, in such wise, that the inside of her hand rested upon the back of
his--she raised her fingers, and let them fall--it could scarce be call'd a
tap; or if it was a tap--'twould have puzzled a casuist to say, whether
'twas a tap of remonstrance, or a tap of confession: my father, who was
all sensibilities from head to foot, class'd it right--Conscience redoubled
her blow--he turn'd his face suddenly the other way, and my mother
supposing his body was about to turn with it in order to move homewards, by
a cross movement of her right leg, keeping her left as its centre, brought
herself so far in front, that as he turned his head, he met her eye--
Confusion again! he saw a thousand reasons to wipe out the reproach, and as
many to reproach himself--a thin, blue, chill, pellucid chrystal with all
its humours so at rest, the least mote or speck of desire might have been
seen, at the bottom of it, had it existed--it did not--and how I happen to
be so lewd myself, particularly a little before the vernal and autumnal
equinoxes--Heaven above knows--My mother--madam--was so at no time, either
by nature, by institution, or example.
A temperate current of blood ran orderly through her veins in all months of
the year, and in all critical moments both of the day and night alike; nor
did she superinduce the least heat into her humours from the manual
effervescencies of devotional tracts, which having little or no meaning in
them, nature is oft-times obliged to find one--And as for my father's
example! 'twas so far from being either aiding or abetting thereunto, that
'twas the whole business of his life, to keep all fancies of that kind out
of her head--Nature had done her part, to have spared him this trouble; and
what was not a little inconsistent, my father knew it--And here am I
sitting, this 12th day of August 1766, in a purple jerkin and yellow pair
of slippers, without either wig or cap on, a most tragicomical completion
of his prediction, 'That I should neither think, nor act like any other
man's child, upon that very account.'
The mistake in my father, was in attacking my mother's motive, instead of
the act itself; for certainly key-holes were made for other purposes; and
considering the act, as an act which interfered with a true proposition,
and denied a key-hole to be what it was--it became a violation of nature;
and was so far, you see, criminal.
It is for this reason, an' please your Reverences, That key-holes are the
occasions of more sin and wickedness, than all other holes in this world
put together.
--which leads me to my uncle Toby's amours.
Chapter 4.LXI.
Though the corporal had been as good as his word in putting my uncle Toby's
great ramallie-wig into pipes, yet the time was too short to produce any
great effects from it: it had lain many years squeezed up in the corner of
his old campaign trunk; and as bad forms are not so easy to be got the
better of, and the use of candle-ends not so well understood, it was not so
pliable a business as one would have wished. The corporal with cheary eye
and both arms extended, had fallen back perpendicular from it a score
times, to inspire it, if possible, with a better air--had Spleen given a
look at it, 'twould have cost her ladyship a smile--it curl'd every where
but where the corporal would have it; and where a buckle or two, in his
opinion, would have done it honour, he could as soon have raised the dead.
Such it was--or rather such would it have seem'd upon any other brow; but
the sweet look of goodness which sat upon my uncle Toby's, assimilated
every thing around it so sovereignly to itself, and Nature had moreover
wrote Gentleman with so fair a hand in every line of his countenance, that
even his tarnish'd gold-laced hat and huge cockade of flimsy taffeta became
him; and though not worth a button in themselves, yet the moment my uncle
Toby put them on, they became serious objects, and altogether seem'd to
have been picked up by the hand of Science to set him off to advantage.
Nothing in this world could have co-operated more powerfully towards this,
than my uncle Toby's blue and gold--had not Quantity in some measure been
necessary to Grace: in a period of fifteen or sixteen years since they had
been made, by a total inactivity in my uncle Toby's life, for he seldom
went further than the bowling-green--his blue and gold had become so
miserably too straight for him, that it was with the utmost difficulty the
corporal was able to get him into them; the taking them up at the sleeves,
was of no advantage.--They were laced however down the back, and at the
seams of the sides, &c. in the mode of King William's reign; and to shorten
all description, they shone so bright against the sun that morning, and had
so metallick and doughty an air with them, that had my uncle Toby thought
of attacking in armour, nothing could have so well imposed upon his
imagination.
As for the thin scarlet breeches, they had been unripp'd by the taylor
between the legs, and left at sixes and sevens--
--Yes, Madam,--but let us govern our fancies. It is enough they were held
impracticable the night before, and as there was no alternative in my uncle
Toby's wardrobe, he sallied forth in the red plush.
The corporal had array'd himself in poor Le Fever's regimental coat; and
with his hair tuck'd up under his Montero-cap, which he had furbish'd up
for the occasion, march'd three paces distant from his master: a whiff of
military pride had puff'd out his shirt at the wrist; and upon that in a
black leather thong clipp'd into a tassel beyond the knot, hung the
corporal's stick--my uncle Toby carried his cane like a pike.
--It looks well at least; quoth my father to himself.
Chapter 4.LXII.
My uncle Toby turn'd his head more than once behind him, to see how he was
supported by the corporal; and the corporal as oft as he did it, gave a
slight flourish with his stick--but not vapouringly; and with the sweetest
accent of most respectful encouragement, bid his honour 'never fear.'
Now my uncle Toby did fear; and grievously too; he knew not (as my father
had reproach'd him) so much as the right end of a Woman from the wrong, and
therefore was never altogether at his ease near any one of them--unless in
sorrow or distress; then infinite was his pity; nor would the most
courteous knight of romance have gone further, at least upon one leg, to
have wiped away a tear from a woman's eye; and yet excepting once that he
was beguiled into it by Mrs. Wadman, he had never looked stedfastly into
one; and would often tell my father in the simplicity of his heart, that it
was almost (if not about) as bad as taking bawdy.--
--And suppose it is? my father would say.
Chapter 4.LXIII.
She cannot, quoth my uncle Toby, halting, when they had march'd up to
within twenty paces of Mrs. Wadman's door--she cannot, corporal, take it
amiss.--
--She will take it, an' please your honour, said the corporal, just as the
Jew's widow at Lisbon took it of my brother Tom.--
--And how was that? quoth my uncle Toby, facing quite about to the
corporal.
Your honour, replied the corporal, knows of Tom's misfortunes; but this
affair has nothing to do with them any further than this, That if Tom had
not married the widow--or had it pleased God after their marriage, that
they had but put pork into their sausages, the honest soul had never been
taken out of his warm bed, and dragg'd to the inquisition--'Tis a cursed
place--added the corporal, shaking his head,--when once a poor creature is
in, he is in, an' please your honour, for ever.
'Tis very true; said my uncle Toby, looking gravely at Mrs. Wadman's house,
as he spoke.
Nothing, continued the corporal, can be so sad as confinement for life--or
so sweet, an' please your honour, as liberty.
Nothing, Trim--said my uncle Toby, musing--
Whilst a man is free,--cried the corporal, giving a flourish with his stick
thus--
(squiggly line diagonally across the page)
A thousand of my father's most subtle syllogisms could not have said more
for celibacy.
My uncle Toby look'd earnestly towards his cottage and his bowling-green.
The corporal had unwarily conjured up the Spirit of calculation with his
wand; and he had nothing to do, but to conjure him down again with his
story, and in this form of Exorcism, most un-ecclesiastically did the
corporal do it.
Chapter 4.LXIV.
As Tom's place, an' please your honour, was easy--and the weather warm--it
put him upon thinking seriously of settling himself in the world; and as it
fell out about that time, that a Jew who kept a sausage shop in the same
street, had the ill luck to die of a strangury, and leave his widow in
possession of a rousing trade--Tom thought (as every body in Lisbon was
doing the best he could devise for himself) there could be no harm in
offering her his service to carry it on: so without any introduction to
the widow, except that of buying a pound of sausages at her shop--Tom set
out--counting the matter thus within himself, as he walk'd along; that let
the worst come of it that could, he should at least get a pound of sausages
for their worth--but, if things went well, he should be set up; inasmuch as
he should get not only a pound of sausages--but a wife and--a sausage shop,
an' please your honour, into the bargain.
Every servant in the family, from high to low, wish'd Tom success; and I
can fancy, an' please your honour, I see him this moment with his white
dimity waist-coat and breeches, and hat a little o' one side, passing
jollily along the street, swinging his stick, with a smile and a chearful
word for every body he met:--But alas! Tom! thou smilest no more, cried the
corporal, looking on one side of him upon the ground, as if he
apostrophised him in his dungeon.
Poor fellow! said my uncle Toby, feelingly.
He was an honest, light-hearted lad, an' please your honour, as ever blood
warm'd--
--Then he resembled thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby, rapidly.
The corporal blush'd down to his fingers ends--a tear of sentimental
bashfulness--another of gratitude to my uncle Toby--and a tear of sorrow
for his brother's misfortunes, started into his eye, and ran sweetly down
his cheek together; my uncle Toby's kindled as one lamp does at another;
and taking hold of the breast of Trim's coat (which had been that of Le
Fever's) as if to ease his lame leg, but in reality to gratify a finer
feeling--he stood silent for a minute and a half; at the end of which he
took his hand away, and the corporal making a bow, went on with his story
of his brother and the Jew's widow.
Chapter 4.LXV.
When Tom, an' please your honour, got to the shop, there was nobody in it,
but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the
end of a long cane, flapping away flies--not killing them.--'Tis a pretty
picture! said my uncle Toby--she had suffered persecution, Trim, and had
learnt mercy--
--She was good, an' please your honour, from nature, as well as from
hardships; and there are circumstances in the story of that poor friendless
slut, that would melt a heart of stone, said Trim; and some dismal winter's
evening, when your honour is in the humour, they shall be told you with the
rest of Tom's story, for it makes a part of it--
Then do not forget, Trim, said my uncle Toby.
A negro has a soul? an' please your honour, said the corporal (doubtingly).
I am not much versed, corporal, quoth my uncle Toby, in things of that
kind; but I suppose, God would not leave him without one, any more than
thee or me--
--It would be putting one sadly over the head of another, quoth the
corporal.
It would so; said my uncle Toby. Why then, an' please your honour, is a
black wench to be used worse than a white one?
I can give no reason, said my uncle Toby--
--Only, cried the corporal, shaking his head, because she has no one to
stand up for her--
--'Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby,--which recommends her to
protection--and her brethren with her; 'tis the fortune of war which has
put the whip into our hands now--where it may be hereafter, heaven knows!--
but be it where it will, the brave, Trim! will not use it unkindly.
--God forbid, said the corporal.
Amen, responded my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon his heart.
The corporal returned to his story, and went on--but with an embarrassment
in doing it, which here and there a reader in this world will not be able
to comprehend; for by the many sudden transitions all along, from one kind
and cordial passion to another, in getting thus far on his way, he had lost
the sportable key of his voice, which gave sense and spirit to his tale: 
he attempted twice to resume it, but could not please himself; so giving a
stout hem! to rally back the retreating spirits, and aiding nature at the
same time with his left arm a kimbo on one side, and with his right a
little extended, supporting her on the other--the corporal got as near the
note as he could; and in that attitude, continued his story.
Chapter 4.LXVI.
As Tom, an' please your honour, had no business at that time with the
Moorish girl, he passed on into the room beyond, to talk to the Jew's widow
about love--and this pound of sausages; and being, as I have told your
honour, an open cheary-hearted lad, with his character wrote in his looks
and carriage, he took a chair, and without much apology, but with great
civility at the same time, placed it close to her at the table, and sat
down.
There is nothing so awkward, as courting a woman, an' please your honour,
whilst she is making sausages--So Tom began a discourse upon them; first,
gravely,--'as how they were made--with what meats, herbs, and spices.'--
Then a little gayly,--as, 'With what skins--and if they never burst--
Whether the largest were not the best?'--and so on--taking care only as he
went along, to season what he had to say upon sausages, rather under than
over;--that he might have room to act in--
It was owing to the neglect of that very precaution, said my uncle Toby,
laying his hand upon Trim's shoulder, that Count De la Motte lost the
battle of Wynendale: he pressed too speedily into the wood; which if he
had not done, Lisle had not fallen into our hands, nor Ghent and Bruges,
which both followed her example; it was so late in the year, continued my
uncle Toby, and so terrible a season came on, that if things had not fallen
out as they did, our troops must have perish'd in the open field.--
--Why, therefore, may not battles, an' please your honour, as well as
marriages, be made in heaven?--my uncle Toby mused--
Religion inclined him to say one thing, and his high idea of military skill
tempted him to say another; so not being able to frame a reply exactly to
his mind--my uncle Toby said nothing at all; and the corporal finished his
story.
As Tom perceived, an' please your honour, that he gained ground, and that
all he had said upon the subject of sausages was kindly taken, he went on
to help her a little in making them.--First, by taking hold of the ring of
the sausage whilst she stroked the forced meat down with her hand--then by
cutting the strings into proper lengths, and holding them in his hand,
whilst she took them out one by one--then, by putting them across her
mouth, that she might take them out as she wanted them--and so on from
little to more, till at last he adventured to tie the sausage himself,
whilst she held the snout.--
--Now a widow, an' please your honour, always chuses a second husband as
unlike the first as she can: so the affair was more than half settled in
her mind before Tom mentioned it.
She made a feint however of defending herself, by snatching up a sausage:--
Tom instantly laid hold of another--
But seeing Tom's had more gristle in it--
She signed the capitulation--and Tom sealed it; and there was an end of the
matter.
Chapter 4.LXVII.
All womankind, continued Trim, (commenting upon his story) from the highest
to the lowest, an' please your honour, love jokes; the difficulty is to
know how they chuse to have them cut; and there is no knowing that, but by
trying, as we do with our artillery in the field, by raising or letting
down their breeches, till we hit the mark.--
--I like the comparison, said my uncle Toby, better than the thing itself--
--Because your honour, quoth the corporal, loves glory, more than pleasure.
I hope, Trim, answered my uncle Toby, I love mankind more than either; and
as the knowledge of arms tends so apparently to the good and quiet of the
world--and particularly that branch of it which we have practised together
in our bowling-green, has no object but to shorten the strides of Ambition,
and intrench the lives and fortunes of the few, from the plunderings of the
many--whenever that drum beats in our ears, I trust, corporal, we shall
neither of us want so much humanity and fellow-feeling, as to face about
and march.
In pronouncing this, my uncle Toby faced about, and march'd firmly as at
the head of his company--and the faithful corporal, shouldering his stick,
and striking his hand upon his coat-skirt as he took his first step--
march'd close behind him down the avenue.
--Now what can their two noddles be about? cried my father to my mother--by
all that's strange, they are besieging Mrs. Wadman in form, and are
marching round her house to mark out the lines of circumvallation.
I dare say, quoth my mother--But stop, dear Sir--for what my mother dared
to say upon the occasion--and what my father did say upon it--with her
replies and his rejoinders, shall be read, perused, paraphrased, commented,
and descanted upon--or to say it all in a word, shall be thumb'd over by
Posterity in a chapter apart--I say, by Posterity--and care not, if I
repeat the word again--for what has this book done more than the Legation
of Moses, or the Tale of a Tub, that it may not swim down the gutter of
Time along with them?
I will not argue the matter: Time wastes too fast: every letter I trace
tells me with what rapidity Life follows my pen: the days and hours of it,
more precious, my dear Jenny! than the rubies about thy neck, are flying
over our heads like light clouds of a windy day, never to return more--
every thing presses on--whilst thou art twisting that lock,--see! it grows
grey; and every time I kiss thy hand to bid adieu, and every absence which
follows it, are preludes to that eternal separation which we are shortly to
make.--
--Heaven have mercy upon us both!
Chapter 4.LXVIII.
Now, for what the world thinks of that ejaculation--I would not give a
groat.
Chapter 4.LXIX.
My mother had gone with her left arm twisted in my father's right, till
they had got to the fatal angle of the old garden wall, where Doctor Slop
was overthrown by Obadiah on the coach-horse: as this was directly
opposite to the front of Mrs. Wadman's house, when my father came to it, he
gave a look across; and seeing my uncle Toby and the corporal within ten
paces of the door, he turn'd about--'Let us just stop a moment, quoth my
father, and see with what ceremonies my brother Toby and his man Trim make
their first entry--it will not detain us, added my father, a single
minute:'
--No matter, if it be ten minutes, quoth my mother.
--It will not detain us half one; said my father.
The corporal was just then setting in with the story of his brother Tom and
the Jew's widow: the story went on--and on--it had episodes in it--it came
back, and went on--and on again; there was no end of it--the reader found
it very long--
--G.. help my father! he pish'd fifty times at every new attitude, and gave
the corporal's stick, with all its flourishings and danglings, to as many
devils as chose to accept of them.
When issues of events like these my father is waiting for, are hanging in
the scales of fate, the mind has the advantage of changing the principle of
expectation three times, without which it would not have power to see it
out.
Curiosity governs the first moment; and the second moment is all oeconomy
to justify the expence of the first--and for the third, fourth, fifth, and
sixth moments, and so on to the day of judgment--'tis a point of Honour.
I need not be told, that the ethic writers have assigned this all to
Patience; but that Virtue, methinks, has extent of dominion sufficient of
her own, and enough to do in it, without invading the few dismantled
castles which Honour has left him upon the earth.
My father stood it out as well as he could with these three auxiliaries to
the end of Trim's story; and from thence to the end of my uncle Toby's
panegyrick upon arms, in the chapter following it; when seeing, that
instead of marching up to Mrs. Wadman's door, they both faced about and
march'd down the avenue diametrically opposite to his expectation--he broke
out at once with that little subacid soreness of humour, which, in certain
situations, distinguished his character from that of all other men.
Chapter 4.LXX.
--'Now what can their two noddles be about?' cried my father. . .&c. . ..
I dare say, said my mother, they are making fortifications--
--Not on Mrs. Wadman's premises! cried my father, stepping back--
I suppose not: quoth my mother.
I wish, said my father, raising his voice, the whole science of
fortification at the devil, with all its trumpery of saps, mines, blinds,
gabions, fausse-brays and cuvetts--
--They are foolish things--said my mother.
Now she had a way, which, by the bye, I would this moment give away my
purple jerkin, and my yellow slippers into the bargain, if some of your
reverences would imitate--and that was, never to refuse her assent and
consent to any proposition my father laid before her, merely because she
did not understand it, or had no ideas of the principal word or term of
art, upon which the tenet or proposition rolled. She contented herself
with doing all that her godfathers and godmothers promised for her--but no
more; and so would go on using a hard word twenty years together--and
replying to it too, if it was a verb, in all its moods and tenses, without
giving herself any trouble to enquire about it.
This was an eternal source of misery to my father, and broke the neck, at
the first setting out, of more good dialogues between them, than could have
done the most petulant contradiction--the few which survived were the
better for the cuvetts--
--'They are foolish things;' said my mother.
--Particularly the cuvetts; replied my father.
'Tis enough--he tasted the sweet of triumph--and went on.
--Not that they are, properly speaking, Mrs. Wadman's premises, said my
father, partly correcting himself--because she is but tenant for life--
--That makes a great difference--said my mother--
--In a fool's head, replied my father--
Unless she should happen to have a child--said my mother--
--But she must persuade my brother Toby first to get her one--
To be sure, Mr. Shandy, quoth my mother.
--Though if it comes to persuasion--said my father--Lord have mercy upon
them.
Amen: said my mother, piano.
Amen: cried my father, fortissime.
Amen: said my mother again--but with such a sighing cadence of personal
pity at the end of it, as discomfited every fibre about my father--he
instantly took out his almanack; but before he could untie it, Yorick's
congregation coming out of church, became a full answer to one half of his
business with it--and my mother telling him it was a sacrament day--left
him as little in doubt, as to the other part--He put his almanack into his
pocket.
The first Lord of the Treasury thinking of ways and means, could not have
returned home with a more embarrassed look.
Chapter 4.LXXI.
Upon looking back from the end of the last chapter, and surveying the
texture of what has been wrote, it is necessary, that upon this page and
the three following, a good quantity of heterogeneous matter be inserted to
keep up that just balance betwixt wisdom and folly, without which a book
would not hold together a single year: nor is it a poor creeping digression
(which but for the name of, a man might continue as well going on in the
king's highway) which will do the business--no; if it is to be a
digression, it must be a good frisky one, and upon a frisky subject too,
where neither the horse or his rider are to be caught, but by rebound.
The only difficulty, is raising powers suitable to the nature of the
service: Fancy is capricious--Wit must not be searched for--and Pleasantry
(good-natured slut as she is) will not come in at a call, was an empire to
be laid at her feet.
--The best way for a man, is to say his prayers--
Only if it puts him in mind of his infirmities and defects as well ghostly
as bodily--for that purpose, he will find himself rather worse after he has
said them than before--for other purposes, better.
For my own part, there is not a way either moral or mechanical under heaven
that I could think of, which I have not taken with myself in this case: 
sometimes by addressing myself directly to the soul herself, and arguing
the point over and over again with her upon the extent of her own
faculties--
--I never could make them an inch the wider--
Then by changing my system, and trying what could be made of it upon the
body, by temperance, soberness, and chastity: These are good, quoth I, in
themselves--they are good, absolutely;--they are good, relatively;--they
are good for health--they are good for happiness in this world--they are
good for happiness in the next--
In short, they were good for every thing but the thing wanted; and there
they were good for nothing, but to leave the soul just as heaven made it: 
as for the theological virtues of faith and hope, they give it courage; but
then that snivelling virtue of Meekness (as my father would always call it)
takes it quite away again, so you are exactly where you started.
Now in all common and ordinary cases, there is nothing which I have found
to answer so well as this--
--Certainly, if there is any dependence upon Logic, and that I am not
blinded by self-love, there must be something of true genius about me,
merely upon this symptom of it, that I do not know what envy is: for never
do I hit upon any invention or device which tendeth to the furtherance of
good writing, but I instantly make it public; willing that all mankind
should write as well as myself.
--Which they certainly will, when they think as little.
Chapter 4.LXXII.
Now in ordinary cases, that is, when I am only stupid, and the thoughts
rise heavily and pass gummous through my pen--
Or that I am got, I know not how, into a cold unmetaphorical vein of
infamous writing, and cannot take a plumb-lift out of it for my soul; so
must be obliged to go on writing like a Dutch commentator to the end of the
chapter, unless something be done--
--I never stand conferring with pen and ink one moment; for if a pinch of
snuff, or a stride or two across the room will not do the business for me--
I take a razor at once; and having tried the edge of it upon the palm of my
hand, without further ceremony, except that of first lathering my beard, I
shave it off; taking care only if I do leave a hair, that it be not a grey
one: this done, I change my shirt--put on a better coat--send for my last
wig--put my topaz ring upon my finger; and in a word, dress myself from one
end to the other of me, after my best fashion.
Now the devil in hell must be in it, if this does not do: for consider,
Sir, as every man chuses to be present at the shaving of his own beard
(though there is no rule without an exception), and unavoidably sits over-
against himself the whole time it is doing, in case he has a hand in it--
the Situation, like all others, has notions of her own to put into the
brain.--
--I maintain it, the conceits of a rough-bearded man, are seven years more
terse and juvenile for one single operation; and if they did not run a risk
of being quite shaved away, might be carried up by continual shavings, to
the highest pitch of sublimity--How Homer could write with so long a beard,
I don't know--and as it makes against my hypothesis, I as little care--But
let us return to the Toilet.
Ludovicus Sorbonensis makes this entirely an affair of the body (Greek) as
he calls it--but he is deceived: the soul and body are joint-sharers in
every thing they get: A man cannot dress, but his ideas get cloth'd at the
same time; and if he dresses like a gentleman, every one of them stands
presented to his imagination, genteelized along with him--so that he has
nothing to do, but take his pen, and write like himself.
For this cause, when your honours and reverences would know whether I writ
clean and fit to be read, you will be able to judge full as well by looking
into my Laundress's bill, as my book: there is one single month in which I
can make it appear, that I dirtied one and thirty shirts with clean
writing; and after all, was more abus'd, cursed, criticis'd, and
confounded, and had more mystic heads shaken at me, for what I had wrote in
that one month, than in all the other months of that year put together.
--But their honours and reverences had not seen my bills.
Chapter 4.LXXIII.
As I never had any intention of beginning the Digression, I am making all
this preparation for, till I come to the 74th chapter--I have this chapter
to put to whatever use I think proper--I have twenty this moment ready for
it--I could write my chapter of Button-holes in it--
Or my chapter of Pishes, which should follow them--
Or my chapter of Knots, in case their reverences have done with them--they
might lead me into mischief: the safest way is to follow the track of the
learned, and raise objections against what I have been writing, tho' I
declare before-hand, I know no more than my heels how to answer them.
And first, it may be said, there is a pelting kind of thersitical satire,
as black as the very ink 'tis wrote with--(and by the bye, whoever says so,
is indebted to the muster-master general of the Grecian army, for suffering
the name of so ugly and foul-mouth'd a man as Thersites to continue upon
his roll--for it has furnish'd him with an epithet)--in these productions
he will urge, all the personal washings and scrubbings upon earth do a
sinking genius no sort of good--but just the contrary, inasmuch as the
dirtier the fellow is, the better generally he succeeds in it.
To this, I have no other answer--at least ready--but that the Archbishop of
Benevento wrote his nasty Romance of the Galatea, as all the world knows,
in a purple coat, waistcoat, and purple pair of breeches; and that the
penance set him of writing a commentary upon the book of the Revelations,
as severe as it was look'd upon by one part of the world, was far from
being deem'd so, by the other, upon the single account of that Investment.
Another objection, to all this remedy, is its want of universality;
forasmuch as the shaving part of it, upon which so much stress is laid, by
an unalterable law of nature excludes one half of the species entirely from
its use: all I can say is, that female writers, whether of England, or of
France, must e'en go without it--
As for the Spanish ladies--I am in no sort of distress--
Chapter 4.LXXIV.
The seventy-fourth chapter is come at last; and brings nothing with it but
a sad signature of 'How our pleasures slip from under us in this world!'
For in talking of my digression--I declare before heaven I have made it! 
What a strange creature is mortal man! said she.
'Tis very true, said I--but 'twere better to get all these things out of
our heads, and return to my uncle Toby.
Chapter 4.LXXV.
When my uncle Toby and the corporal had marched down to the bottom of the
avenue, they recollected their business lay the other way; so they faced
about and marched up straight to Mrs. Wadman's door.
I warrant your honour; said the corporal, touching his Montero-cap with his
hand, as he passed him in order to give a knock at the door--My uncle Toby,
contrary to his invariable way of treating his faithful servant, said
nothing good or bad: the truth was, he had not altogether marshal'd his
ideas; he wish'd for another conference, and as the corporal was mounting
up the three steps before the door--he hem'd twice--a portion of my uncle
Toby's most modest spirits fled, at each expulsion, towards the corporal;
he stood with the rapper of the door suspended for a full minute in his
hand, he scarce knew why. Bridget stood perdue within, with her finger and
her thumb upon the latch, benumb'd with expectation; and Mrs. Wadman, with
an eye ready to be deflowered again, sat breathless behind the window-
curtain of her bed-chamber, watching their approach.
Trim! said my uncle Toby--but as he articulated the word, the minute
expired, and Trim let fall the rapper.
My uncle Toby perceiving that all hopes of a conference were knock'd on the
head by it--whistled Lillabullero.
Chapter 4.LXXVI.
As Mrs. Bridget's finger and thumb were upon the latch, the corporal did
not knock as often as perchance your honour's taylor--I might have taken my
example something nearer home; for I owe mine, some five and twenty pounds
at least, and wonder at the man's patience--
--But this is nothing at all to the world: only 'tis a cursed thing to be
in debt; and there seems to be a fatality in the exchequers of some poor
princes, particularly those of our house, which no Economy can bind down in
irons: for my own part, I'm persuaded there is not any one prince,
prelate, pope, or potentate, great or small upon earth, more desirous in
his heart of keeping straight with the world than I am--or who takes more
likely means for it. I never give above half a guinea--or walk with boots-
-or cheapen tooth-picks--or lay out a shilling upon a band-box the year
round; and for the six months I'm in the country, I'm upon so small a
scale, that with all the good temper in the world, I outdo Rousseau, a bar
length--for I keep neither man or boy, or horse, or cow, or dog, or cat, or
any thing that can eat or drink, except a thin poor piece of a Vestal (to
keep my fire in), and who has generally as bad an appetite as myself--but
if you think this makes a philosopher of me--I would not, my good people!
give a rush for your judgments.
True philosophy--but there is no treating the subject whilst my uncle is
whistling Lillabullero.
--Let us go into the house.
Chapter 4.LXXVII.

Chapter 4.LXXIX.
--(two blank paragraphs)--
--You shall see the very place, Madam; said my uncle Toby.
Mrs. Wadman blush'd--look'd towards the door--turn'd pale--blush'd slightly
again--recover'd her natural colour--blush'd worse than ever; which, for
the sake of the unlearned reader, I translate thus--
'L..d! I cannot look at it--
'What would the world say if I look'd at it?
'I should drop down, if I look'd at it--
'I wish I could look at it--
'There can be no sin in looking at it.
--'I will look at it.'
Whilst all this was running through Mrs. Wadman's imagination, my uncle
Toby had risen from the sopha, and got to the other side of the parlour
door, to give Trim an order about it in the passage--
. . .--I believe it is in the garret, said my uncle Toby--I saw it there,
an' please your honour, this morning, answered Trim--Then prithee, step
directly for it, Trim, said my uncle Toby, and bring it into the parlour.
The corporal did not approve of the orders, but most cheerfully obeyed
them. The first was not an act of his will--the second was; so he put on
his Montero-cap, and went as fast as his lame knee would let him. My uncle
Toby returned into the parlour, and sat himself down again upon the sopha.
--You shall lay your finger upon the place--said my uncle Toby.--I will not
touch it, however, quoth Mrs. Wadman to herself.
This requires a second translation:--it shews what little knowledge is got
by mere words--we must go up to the first springs.
Now in order to clear up the mist which hangs upon these three pages, I
must endeavour to be as clear as possible myself.
Rub your hands thrice across your foreheads--blow your noses--cleanse your
emunctories--sneeze, my good people!--God bless you--
Now give me all the help you can.
Chapter 4.LXXX.
As there are fifty different ends (counting all ends in--as well civil as
religious) for which a woman takes a husband, the first sets about and
carefully weighs, then separates and distinguishes in her mind, which of
all that number of ends is hers; then by discourse, enquiry, argumentation,
and inference, she investigates and finds out whether she has got hold of
the right one--and if she has--then, by pulling it gently this way and that
way, she further forms a judgment, whether it will not break in the
drawing.
The imagery under which Slawkenbergius impresses this upon the reader's
fancy, in the beginning of his third Decad, is so ludicrous, that the
honour I bear the sex, will not suffer me to quote it--otherwise it is not
destitute of humour.
'She first, saith Slawkenbergius, stops the asse, and holding his halter in
her left hand (lest he should get away) she thrusts her right hand into the
very bottom of his pannier to search for it--For what?--you'll not know the
sooner, quoth Slawkenbergius, for interrupting me--
'I have nothing, good Lady, but empty bottles;' says the asse.
'I'm loaded with tripes;' says the second.
--And thou art little better, quoth she to the third; for nothing is there
in thy panniers but trunk-hose and pantofles--and so to the fourth and
fifth, going on one by one through the whole string, till coming to the
asse which carries it, she turns the pannier upside down, looks at it--
considers it--samples it--measures it--stretches it--wets it--dries it--
then takes her teeth both to the warp and weft of it.
--Of what? for the love of Christ!
I am determined, answered Slawkenbergius, that all the powers upon earth
shall never wring that secret from my breast.
Chapter 4.LXXXI.
We live in a world beset on all sides with mysteries and riddles--and so
'tis no matter--else it seems strange, that Nature, who makes every thing
so well to answer its destination, and seldom or never errs, unless for
pastime, in giving such forms and aptitudes to whatever passes through her
hands, that whether she designs for the plough, the caravan, the cart--or
whatever other creature she models, be it but an asse's foal, you are sure
to have the thing you wanted; and yet at the same time should so eternally
bungle it as she does, in making so simple a thing as a married man.
Whether it is in the choice of the clay--or that it is frequently spoiled
in the baking; by an excess of which a husband may turn out too crusty (you
know) on one hand--or not enough so, through defect of heat, on the other--
or whether this great Artificer is not so attentive to the little Platonic
exigences of that part of the species, for whose use she is fabricating
this--or that her Ladyship sometimes scarce knows what sort of a husband
will do--I know not: we will discourse about it after supper.
It is enough, that neither the observation itself, or the reasoning upon
it, are at all to the purpose--but rather against it; since with regard to
my uncle Toby's fitness for the marriage state, nothing was ever better:
she had formed him of the best and kindliest clay--had temper'd it with her
own milk, and breathed into it the sweetest spirit--she had made him all
gentle, generous, and humane--she had filled his heart with trust and
confidence, and disposed every passage which led to it, for the
communication of the tenderest offices--she had moreover considered the
other causes for which matrimony was ordained--
And accordingly. . ..
The Donation was not defeated by my uncle Toby's wound.
Now this last article was somewhat apocryphal; and the Devil, who is the
great disturber of our faiths in this world, had raised scruples in Mrs.
Wadman's brain about it; and like a true devil as he was, had done his own
work at the same time, by turning my uncle Toby's Virtue thereupon into
nothing but empty bottles, tripes, trunk-hose, and pantofles.
Chapter 4.LXXXII.
Mrs. Bridget had pawn'd all the little stock of honour a poor chamber-maid
was worth in the world, that she would get to the bottom of the affair in
ten days; and it was built upon one of the most concessible postulata in
nature: namely, that whilst my uncle Toby was making love to her mistress,
the corporal could find nothing better to do, than make love to her--'And
I'll let him as much as he will, said Bridget, to get it out of him.'
Friendship has two garments; an outer and an under one. Bridget was
serving her mistress's interests in the one--and doing the thing which most
pleased herself in the other: so had as many stakes depending upon my
uncle Toby's wound, as the Devil himself--Mrs. Wadman had but one--and as
it possibly might be her last (without discouraging Mrs. Bridget, or
discrediting her talents) was determined to play her cards herself.
She wanted not encouragement: a child might have look'd into his hand--
there was such a plainness and simplicity in his playing out what trumps he
had--with such an unmistrusting ignorance of the ten-ace--and so naked and
defenceless did he sit upon the same sopha with widow Wadman, that a
generous heart would have wept to have won the game of him.
Let us drop the metaphor.
Chapter 4.LXXXIII.
--And the story too--if you please: for though I have all along been
hastening towards this part of it, with so much earnest desire, as well
knowing it to be the choicest morsel of what I had to offer to the world,
yet now that I am got to it, any one is welcome to take my pen, and go on
with the story for me that will--I see the difficulties of the descriptions
I'm going to give--and feel my want of powers.
It is one comfort at least to me, that I lost some fourscore ounces of
blood this week in a most uncritical fever which attacked me at the
beginning of this chapter; so that I have still some hopes remaining, it
may be more in the serous or globular parts of the blood, than in the
subtile aura of the brain--be it which it will--an Invocation can do no
hurt--and I leave the affair entirely to the invoked, to inspire or to
inject me according as he sees good.
The Invocation.
Gentle Spirit of sweetest humour, who erst did sit upon the easy pen of my
beloved Cervantes; Thou who glidedst daily through his lattice, and
turned'st the twilight of his prison into noon-day brightness by thy
presence--tinged'st his little urn of water with heaven-sent nectar, and
all the time he wrote of Sancho and his master, didst cast thy mystic
mantle o'er his wither'd stump (He lost his hand at the battle of
Lepanto.), and wide extended it to all the evils of his life--
--Turn in hither, I beseech thee!--behold these breeches!--they are all I
have in world--that piteous rent was given them at Lyons--
My shirts! see what a deadly schism has happen'd amongst 'em--for the laps
are in Lombardy, and the rest of 'em here--I never had but six, and a
cunning gypsey of a laundress at Milan cut me off the fore-laps of five--To
do her justice, she did it with some consideration--for I was returning out
of Italy.
And yet, notwithstanding all this, and a pistol tinder-box which was
moreover filch'd from me at Sienna, and twice that I pay'd five Pauls for
two hard eggs, once at Raddicoffini, and a second time at Capua--I do not
think a journey through France and Italy, provided a man keeps his temper
all the way, so bad a thing as some people would make you believe: there
must be ups and downs, or how the duce should we get into vallies where
Nature spreads so many tables of entertainment.--'Tis nonsense to imagine
they will lend you their voitures to be shaken to pieces for nothing; and
unless you pay twelve sous for greasing your wheels, how should the poor
peasant get butter to his bread?--We really expect too much--and for the
livre or two above par for your suppers and bed--at the most they are but
one shilling and ninepence halfpenny--who would embroil their philosophy
for it? for heaven's and for your own sake, pay it--pay it with both hands
open, rather than leave Disappointment sitting drooping upon the eye of
your fair Hostess and her Damsels in the gate-way, at your departure--and
besides, my dear Sir, you get a sisterly kiss of each of 'em worth a pound-
-at least I did--
--For my uncle Toby's amours running all the way in my head, they had the
same effect upon me as if they had been my own--I was in the most perfect
state of bounty and good-will; and felt the kindliest harmony vibrating
within me, with every oscillation of the chaise alike; so that whether the
roads were rough or smooth, it made no difference; every thing I saw or had
to do with, touch'd upon some secret spring either of sentiment or rapture.
--They were the sweetest notes I ever heard; and I instantly let down the
fore-glass to hear them more distinctly--'Tis Maria; said the postillion,
observing I was listening--Poor Maria, continued he (leaning his body on
one side to let me see her, for he was in a line betwixt us), is sitting
upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her little goat beside
her.
The young fellow utter'd this with an accent and a look so perfectly in
tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow, I would give him a
four-and-twenty sous piece, when I got to Moulins--
--And who is poor Maria? said I.
The love and piety of all the villages around us; said the postillion--it
is but three years ago, that the sun did not shine upon so fair, so quick-
witted and amiable a maid; and better fate did Maria deserve, than to have
her Banns forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who
published them--
He was going on, when Maria, who had made a short pause, put the pipe to
her mouth, and began the air again--they were the same notes;--yet were ten
times sweeter: It is the evening service to the Virgin, said the young
man--but who has taught her to play it--or how she came by her pipe, no one
knows; we think that heaven has assisted her in both; for ever since she
has been unsettled in her mind, it seems her only consolation--she has
never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that service upon it
almost night and day.
The postillion delivered this with so much discretion and natural
eloquence, that I could not help decyphering something in his face above
his condition, and should have sifted out his history, had not poor Maria
taken such full possession of me.
We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was sitting: she
was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two tresses, drawn up
into a silk-net, with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on
one side--she was beautiful; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest
heart-ache, it was the moment I saw her--
--God help her! poor damsel! above a hundred masses, said the postillion,
have been said in the several parish churches and convents around, for
her,--but without effect; we have still hopes, as she is sensible for short
intervals, that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself; but her
parents, who know her best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her
senses are lost for ever.
As the postillion spoke this, Maria made a cadence so melancholy, so tender
and querulous, that I sprung out of the chaise to help her, and found
myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my
enthusiasm.
Maria look'd wistfully for some time at me, and then at her goat--and then
at me--and then at her goat again, and so on, alternately--
--Well, Maria, said I softly--What resemblance do you find?
I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humblest
conviction of what a Beast man is,--that I asked the question; and that I
would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable
presence of Misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais
scatter'd--and yet I own my heart smote me, and that I so smarted at the
very idea of it, that I swore I would set up for Wisdom, and utter grave
sentences the rest of my days--and never--never attempt again to commit
mirth with man, woman, or child, the longest day I had to live.
As for writing nonsense to them--I believe there was a reserve--but that I
leave to the world.
Adieu, Maria!--adieu, poor hapless damsel!--some time, but not now, I may
hear thy sorrows from thy own lips--but I was deceived; for that moment she
took her pipe and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I rose up, and
with broken and irregular steps walk'd softly to my chaise.
--What an excellent inn at Moulins!
Chapter 4.LXXXIV.
When we have got to the end of this chapter (but not before) we must all
turn back to the two blank chapters, on the account of which my honour has
lain bleeding this half hour--I stop it, by pulling off one of my yellow
slippers and throwing it with all my violence to the opposite side of my
room, with a declaration at the heel of it--
--That whatever resemblance it may bear to half the chapters which are
written in the world, or for aught I know may be now writing in it--that it
was as casual as the foam of Zeuxis his horse; besides, I look upon a
chapter which has only nothing in it, with respect; and considering what
worse things there are in the world--That it is no way a proper subject for
satire--
--Why then was it left so? And here without staying for my reply, shall I
be called as many blockheads, numsculs, doddypoles, dunderheads, ninny-
hammers, goosecaps, joltheads, nincompoops, and sh..t-a-beds--and other
unsavoury appellations, as ever the cake-bakers of Lerne cast in the teeth
of King Garangantan's shepherds--And I'll let them do it, as Bridget said,
as much as they please; for how was it possible they should foresee the
necessity I was under of writing the 84th chapter of my book, before the
77th, &c?
--So I don't take it amiss--All I wish is, that it may be a lesson to the
world, 'to let people tell their stories their own way.'
The Seventy-seventh Chapter.
As Mrs. Bridget opened the door before the corporal had well given the rap,
the interval betwixt that and my uncle Toby's introduction into the
parlour, was so short, that Mrs. Wadman had but just time to get from
behind the curtain--lay a Bible upon the table, and advance a step or two
towards the door to receive him.
My uncle Toby saluted Mrs. Wadman, after the manner in which women were
saluted by men in the year of our Lord God one thousand seven hundred and
thirteen--then facing about, he march'd up abreast with her to the sopha,
and in three plain words--though not before he was sat down--nor after he
was sat down--but as he was sitting down, told her, 'he was in love'--so
that my uncle Toby strained himself more in the declaration than he needed.
Mrs. Wadman naturally looked down, upon a slit she had been darning up in
her apron, in expectation every moment, that my uncle Toby would go on; but
having no talents for amplification, and Love moreover of all others being
a subject of which he was the least a master--When he had told Mrs. Wadman
once that he loved her, he let it alone, and left the matter to work after
its own way.
My father was always in raptures with this system of my uncle Toby's, as he
falsely called it, and would often say, that could his brother Toby to his
processe have added but a pipe of tobacco--he had wherewithal to have found
his way, if there was faith in a Spanish proverb, towards the hearts of
half the women upon the globe.
My uncle Toby never understood what my father meant; nor will I presume to
extract more from it, than a condemnation of an error which the bulk of the
world lie under--but the French, every one of 'em to a man, who believe in
it, almost as much as the Real Presence, 'That talking of love, is making
it.'
--I would as soon set about making a black-pudding by the same receipt.
Let us go on: Mrs. Wadman sat in expectation my uncle Toby would do so, to
almost the first pulsation of that minute, wherein silence on one side or
the other, generally becomes indecent: so edging herself a little more
towards him, and raising up her eyes, sub blushing, as she did it--she took
up the gauntlet--or the discourse (if you like it better) and communed with
my uncle Toby, thus:
The cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth Mrs. Wadman, are
very great. I suppose so--said my uncle Toby: and therefore when a
person, continued Mrs. Wadman, is so much at his ease as you are--so happy,
captain Shandy, in yourself, your friends and your amusements--I wonder,
what reasons can incline you to the state--
--They are written, quoth my uncle Toby, in the Common-Prayer Book.
Thus far my uncle Toby went on warily, and kept within his depth, leaving
Mrs. Wadman to sail upon the gulph as she pleased.
--As for children--said Mrs. Wadman--though a principal end perhaps of the
institution, and the natural wish, I suppose, of every parent--yet do not
we all find, they are certain sorrows, and very uncertain comforts? and
what is there, dear sir, to pay one for the heart-achs--what compensation
for the many tender and disquieting apprehensions of a suffering and
defenceless mother who brings them into life? I declare, said my uncle
Toby, smit with pity, I know of none; unless it be the pleasure which it
has pleased God--
A fiddlestick! quoth she.
Chapter 4.the Seventy-eighth.
Now there are such an infinitude of notes, tunes, cants, chants, airs,
looks, and accents with which the word fiddlestick may be pronounced in all
such causes as this, every one of 'em impressing a sense and meaning as
different from the other, as dirt from cleanliness--That Casuists (for it
is an affair of conscience on that score) reckon up no less than fourteen
thousand in which you may do either right or wrong.
Mrs. Wadman hit upon the fiddlestick, which summoned up all my uncle Toby's
modest blood into his cheeks--so feeling within himself that he had somehow
or other got beyond his depth, he stopt short; and without entering further
either into the pains or pleasures of matrimony, he laid his hand upon his
heart, and made an offer to take them as they were, and share them along
with her.
When my uncle Toby had said this, he did not care to say it again; so
casting his eye upon the Bible which Mrs. Wadman had laid upon the table,
he took it up; and popping, dear soul! upon a passage in it, of all others
the most interesting to him--which was the siege of Jericho--he set himself
to read it over--leaving his proposal of marriage, as he had done his
declaration of love, to work with her after its own way. Now it wrought
neither as an astringent or a loosener; nor like opium, or bark, or
mercury, or buckthorn, or any one drug which nature had bestowed upon the
world--in short, it work'd not at all in her; and the cause of that was,
that there was something working there before--Babbler that I am! I have
anticipated what it was a dozen times; but there is fire still in the
subject--allons.
Chapter 4.LXXXV.
It is natural for a perfect stranger who is going from London to Edinburgh,
to enquire before he sets out, how many miles to York; which is about the
half way--nor does any body wonder, if he goes on and asks about the
corporation, &c. . ..
It was just as natural for Mrs. Wadman, whose first husband was all his
time afflicted with a Sciatica, to wish to know how far from the hip to the
groin; and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in her feelings,
in the one case than in the other.
She had accordingly read Drake's anatomy from one end to the other. She
had peeped into Wharton upon the brain, and borrowed Graaf (This must be a
mistake in Mr. Shandy; for Graaf wrote upon the pancreatick juice, and the
parts of generation.) upon the bones and muscles; but could make nothing of
it.
She had reason'd likewise from her own powers--laid down theorems--drawn
consequences, and come to no conclusion.
To clear up all, she had twice asked Doctor Slop, 'if poor captain Shandy
was ever likely to recover of his wound--?'
--He is recovered, Doctor Slop would say--
What! quite?
Quite: madam--
But what do you mean by a recovery? Mrs. Wadman would say.
Doctor Slop was the worst man alive at definitions; and so Mrs. Wadman
could get no knowledge: in short, there was no way to extract it, but from
my uncle Toby himself.
There is an accent of humanity in an enquiry of this kind which lulls
Suspicion to rest--and I am half persuaded the serpent got pretty near it,
in his discourse with Eve; for the propensity in the sex to be deceived
could not be so great, that she should have boldness to hold chat with the
devil, without it--But there is an accent of humanity--how shall I describe
it?--'tis an accent which covers the part with a garment, and gives the
enquirer a right to be as particular with it, as your body-surgeon.
'--Was it without remission?--
'--Was it more tolerable in bed?
'--Could he lie on both sides alike with it?
'--Was he able to mount a horse?
'--Was motion bad for it?' et caetera, were so tenderly spoke to, and so
directed towards my uncle Toby's heart, that every item of them sunk ten
times deeper into it than the evils themselves--but when Mrs. Wadman went
round about by Namur to get at my uncle Toby's groin; and engaged him to
attack the point of the advanced counterscarp, and pele mele with the Dutch
to take the counterguard of St. Roch sword in hand--and then with tender
notes playing upon his ear, led him all bleeding by the hand out of the
trench, wiping her eye, as he was carried to his tent--Heaven! Earth! Sea!-
-all was lifted up--the springs of nature rose above their levels--an angel
of mercy sat besides him on the sopha--his heart glow'd with fire--and had
he been worth a thousand, he had lost every heart of them to Mrs. Wadman.
--And whereabouts, dear sir, quoth Mrs. Wadman, a little categorically, did
you receive this sad blow?--In asking this question, Mrs. Wadman gave a
slight glance towards the waistband of my uncle Toby's red plush breeches,
expecting naturally, as the shortest reply to it, that my uncle Toby would
lay his fore-finger upon the place--It fell out otherwise--for my uncle
Toby having got his wound before the gate of St. Nicolas, in one of the
traverses of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the demibastion of
St. Roch; he could at any time stick a pin upon the identical spot of
ground where he was standing when the stone struck him: this struck
instantly upon my uncle Toby's sensorium--and with it, struck his large map
of the town and citadel of Namur and its environs, which he had purchased
and pasted down upon a board, by the corporal's aid, during his long
illness--it had lain with other military lumber in the garret ever since,
and accordingly the corporal was detached to the garret to fetch it.
My uncle Toby measured off thirty toises, with Mrs. Wadman's scissars, from
the returning angle before the gate of St. Nicolas; and with such a virgin
modesty laid her finger upon the place, that the goddess of Decency, if
then in being--if not, 'twas her shade--shook her head, and with a finger
wavering across her eyes--forbid her to explain the mistake.
Unhappy Mrs. Wadman!
--For nothing can make this chapter go off with spirit but an apostrophe to
thee--but my heart tells me, that in such a crisis an apostrophe is but an
insult in disguise, and ere I would offer one to a woman in distress--let
the chapter go to the devil; provided any damn'd critic in keeping will be
but at the trouble to take it with him.
Chapter 4.LXXXVI.
My uncle Toby's Map is carried down into the kitchen.
Chapter 4.LXXXVII.
--And here is the Maes--and this is the Sambre; said the corporal, pointing
with his right hand extended a little towards the map, and his left upon
Mrs. Bridget's shoulder--but not the shoulder next him--and this, said he,
is the town of Namur--and this the citadel--and there lay the French--and
here lay his honour and myself--and in this cursed trench, Mrs. Bridget,
quoth the corporal, taking her by the hand, did he receive the wound which
crush'd him so miserably here.--In pronouncing which, he slightly press'd
the back of her hand towards the part he felt for--and let it fall.
We thought, Mr. Trim, it had been more in the middle,--said Mrs. Bridget--
That would have undone us for ever--said the corporal.
--And left my poor mistress undone too, said Bridget.
The corporal made no reply to the repartee, but by giving Mrs. Bridget a
kiss.
Come--come--said Bridget--holding the palm of her left hand parallel to the
plane of the horizon, and sliding the fingers of the other over it, in a
way which could not have been done, had there been the least wart or
protruberance--'Tis every syllable of it false, cried the corporal, before
she had half finished the sentence--
--I know it to be fact, said Bridget, from credible witnesses.
--Upon my honour, said the corporal, laying his hand upon his heart, and
blushing, as he spoke, with honest resentment--'tis a story, Mrs. Bridget,
as false as hell--Not, said Bridget, interrupting him, that either I or my
mistress care a halfpenny about it, whether 'tis so or no--only that when
one is married, one would chuse to have such a thing by one at least--
It was somewhat unfortunate for Mrs. Bridget, that she had begun the attack
with her manual exercise; for the corporal instantly. . ..
Chapter 4.LXXXVIII.
It was like the momentary contest in the moist eye-lids of an April
morning, 'Whether Bridget should laugh or cry.'
She snatch'd up a rolling-pin--'twas ten to one, she had laugh'd--
She laid it down--she cried; and had one single tear of 'em but tasted of
bitterness, full sorrowful would the corporal's heart have been that he had
used the argument; but the corporal understood the sex, a quart major to a
terce at least, better than my uncle Toby, and accordingly he assailed Mrs.
Bridget after this manner.
I know, Mrs. Bridget, said the corporal, giving her a most respectful kiss,
that thou art good and modest by nature, and art withal so generous a girl
in thyself, that, if I know thee rightly, thou would'st not wound an
insect, much less the honour of so gallant and worthy a soul as my master,
wast thou sure to be made a countess of--but thou hast been set on, and
deluded, dear Bridget, as is often a woman's case, 'to please others more
than themselves--'
Bridget's eyes poured down at the sensations the corporal excited.
--Tell me--tell me, then, my dear Bridget, continued the corporal, taking
hold of her hand, which hung down dead by her side,--and giving a second
kiss--whose suspicion has misled thee?
Bridget sobb'd a sob or two--then open'd her eyes--the corporal wiped 'em
with the bottom of her apron--she then open'd her heart and told him all.
Chapter 4.LXXXIX.
My uncle Toby and the corporal had gone on separately with their operations
the greatest part of the campaign, and as effectually cut off from all
communication of what either the one or the other had been doing, as if
they had been separated from each other by the Maes or the Sambre.
My uncle Toby, on his side, had presented himself every afternoon in his
red and silver, and blue and gold alternately, and sustained an infinity of
attacks in them, without knowing them to be attacks--and so had nothing to
communicate--
The corporal, on his side, in taking Bridget, by it had gain'd considerable
advantages--and consequently had much to communicate--but what were the
advantages--as well as what was the manner by which he had seiz'd them,
required so nice an historian, that the corporal durst not venture upon it;
and as sensible as he was of glory, would rather have been contented to
have gone bareheaded and without laurels for ever, than torture his
master's modesty for a single moment--
--Best of honest and gallant servants!--But I have apostrophiz'd thee,
Trim! once before--and could I apotheosize thee also (that is to say) with
good company--I would do it without ceremony in the very next page.
Chapter 4.XC.
Now my uncle Toby had one evening laid down his pipe upon the table, and
was counting over to himself upon his finger ends (beginning at his thumb)
all Mrs. Wadman's perfections one by one; and happening two or three times
together, either by omitting some, or counting others twice over, to puzzle
himself sadly before he could get beyond his middle finger--Prithee, Trim!
said he, taking up his pipe again,--bring me a pen and ink: Trim brought
paper also.
Take a full sheet--Trim! said my uncle Toby, making a sign with his pipe at
the same time to take a chair and sit down close by him at the table. The
corporal obeyed--placed the paper directly before him--took a pen, and
dipp'd it in the ink.
--She has a thousand virtues, Trim! said my uncle Toby--
Am I to set them down, an' please your honour? quoth the corporal.
--But they must be taken in their ranks, replied my uncle Toby; for of them
all, Trim, that which wins me most, and which is a security for all the
rest, is the compassionate turn and singular humanity of her character--I
protest, added my uncle Toby, looking up, as he protested it, towards the
top of the ceiling--That was I her brother, Trim, a thousand fold, she
could not make more constant or more tender enquiries after my sufferings--
though now no more.
The corporal made no reply to my uncle Toby's protestation, but by a short
cough--he dipp'd the pen a second time into the inkhorn; and my uncle Toby,
pointing with the end of his pipe as close to the top of the sheet at the
left hand corner of it, as he could get it--the corporal wrote down the
word
HUMANITY. . .thus.
Prithee, corporal, said my uncle Toby, as soon as Trim had done it--how
often does Mrs. Bridget enquire after the wound on the cap of thy knee,
which thou received'st at the battle of Landen?
She never, an' please your honour, enquires after it at all.
That, corporal, said my uncle Toby, with all the triumph the goodness of
his nature would permit--That shews the difference in the character of the
mistress and maid--had the fortune of war allotted the same mischance to
me, Mrs. Wadman would have enquired into every circumstance relating to it
a hundred times--She would have enquired, an' please your honour, ten times
as often about your honour's groin--The pain, Trim, is equally
excruciating,--and Compassion has as much to do with the one as the other--
--God bless your honour! cried the corporal--what has a woman's compassion
to do with a wound upon the cap of a man's knee? had your honour's been
shot into ten thousand splinters at the affair of Landen, Mrs. Wadman would
have troubled her head as little about it as Bridget; because, added the
corporal, lowering his voice, and speaking very distinctly, as he assigned
his reason--
'The knee is such a distance from the main body--whereas the groin, your
honour knows, is upon the very curtain of the place.'
My uncle Toby gave a long whistle--but in a note which could scarce be
heard across the table.
The corporal had advanced too far to retire--in three words he told the
rest--
My uncle Toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender, as if it had
been spun from the unravellings of a spider's web--
--Let us go to my brother Shandy's, said he.
Chapter 4.XCI.
There will be just time, whilst my uncle Toby and Trim are walking to my
father's, to inform you that Mrs. Wadman had, some moons before this, made
a confident of my mother; and that Mrs. Bridget, who had the burden of her
own, as well as her mistress's secret to carry, had got happily delivered
of both to Susannah behind the garden-wall.
As for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the least bustle
about--but Susannah was sufficient by herself for all the ends and purposes
you could possibly have, in exporting a family secret; for she instantly
imparted it by signs to Jonathan--and Jonathan by tokens to the cook as she
was basting a loin of mutton; the cook sold it with some kitchen-fat to the
postillion for a groat, who truck'd it with the dairy maid for something of
about the same value--and though whisper'd in the hay-loft, Fame caught the
notes with her brazen trumpet, and sounded them upon the house-top--In a
word, not an old woman in the village or five miles round, who did not
understand the difficulties of my uncle Toby's siege, and what were the
secret articles which had delayed the surrender.--
My father, whose way was to force every event in nature into an hypothesis,
by which means never man crucified Truth at the rate he did--had but just
heard of the report as my uncle Toby set out; and catching fire suddenly at
the trespass done his brother by it, was demonstrating to Yorick,
notwithstanding my mother was sitting by--not only, 'That the devil was in
women, and that the whole of the affair was lust;' but that every evil and
disorder in the world, of what kind or nature soever, from the first fall
of Adam, down to my uncle Toby's (inclusive), was owing one way or other to
the same unruly appetite.
Yorick was just bringing my father's hypothesis to some temper, when my
uncle Toby entering the room with marks of infinite benevolence and
forgiveness in his looks, my father's eloquence re-kindled against the
passion--and as he was not very nice in the choice of his words when he was
wroth--as soon as my uncle Toby was seated by the fire, and had filled his
pipe, my father broke out in this manner.
Chapter 4.XCII.
--That provision should be made for continuing the race of so great, so
exalted and godlike a Being as man--I am far from denying--but philosophy
speaks freely of every thing; and therefore I still think and do maintain
it to be a pity, that it should be done by means of a passion which bends
down the faculties, and turns all the wisdom, contemplations, and
operations of the soul backwards--a passion, my dear, continued my father,
addressing himself to my mother, which couples and equals wise men with
fools, and makes us come out of our caverns and hiding-places more like
satyrs and four-footed beasts than men.
I know it will be said, continued my father (availing himself of the
Prolepsis), that in itself, and simply taken--like hunger, or thirst, or
sleep--'tis an affair neither good or bad--or shameful or otherwise.--Why
then did the delicacy of Diogenes and Plato so recalcitrate against it? and
wherefore, when we go about to make and plant a man, do we put out the
candle? and for what reason is it, that all the parts thereof--the
congredients--the preparations--the instruments, and whatever serves
thereto, are so held as to be conveyed to a cleanly mind by no language,
translation, or periphrasis whatever?
--The act of killing and destroying a man, continued my father, raising his
voice--and turning to my uncle Toby--you see, is glorious--and the weapons
by which we do it are honourable--We march with them upon our shoulders--We
strut with them by our sides--We gild them--We carve them--We in-lay them--
We enrich them--Nay, if it be but a scoundrel cannon, we cast an ornament
upon the breach of it.--
--My uncle Toby laid down his pipe to intercede for a better epithet--and
Yorick was rising up to batter the whole hypothesis to pieces--
--When Obadiah broke into the middle of the room with a complaint, which
cried out for an immediate hearing.
The case was this:
My father, whether by ancient custom of the manor, or as impropriator of
the great tythes, was obliged to keep a Bull for the service of the Parish,
and Obadiah had led his cow upon a pop-visit to him one day or other the
preceding summer--I say, one day or other--because as chance would have it,
it was the day on which he was married to my father's house-maid--so one
was a reckoning to the other. Therefore when Obadiah's wife was brought to
bed--Obadiah thanked God--
--Now, said Obadiah, I shall have a calf: so Obadiah went daily to visit
his cow.
She'll calve on Monday--on Tuesday--on Wednesday at the farthest--
The cow did not calve--no--she'll not calve till next week--the cow put it
off terribly--till at the end of the sixth week Obadiah's suspicions (like
a good man's) fell upon the Bull.
Now the parish being very large, my father's Bull, to speak the truth of
him, was no way equal to the department; he had, however, got himself,
somehow or other, thrust into employment--and as he went through the
business with a grave face, my father had a high opinion of him.
--Most of the townsmen, an' please your worship, quoth Obadiah, believe
that 'tis all the Bull's fault--
--But may not a cow be barren? replied my father, turning to Doctor Slop.
It never happens: said Dr. Slop, but the man's wife may have come before
her time naturally enough--Prithee has the child hair upon his head?--added
Dr. Slop--
--It is as hairy as I am; said Obadiah.--Obadiah had not been shaved for
three weeks--Wheu. . .u. . .u. . .cried my father; beginning the sentence
with an exclamatory whistle--and so, brother Toby, this poor Bull of mine,
who is as good a Bull as ever p..ss'd, and might have done for Europa
herself in purer times--had he but two legs less, might have been driven
into Doctors Commons and lost his character--which to a Town Bull, brother
Toby, is the very same thing as his life--
L..d! said my mother, what is all this story about?--
A Cock and a Bull, said Yorick--And one of the best of its kind, I ever
heard.
