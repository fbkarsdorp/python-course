OPINION 
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court. 
For some time, the law has provided that an order for removing an alien present unlawfully may be reinstated if he leaves and unlawfully enters again. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. 104-208, div. C, 110 Stat. 3009-546, enlarged the class of illegal reentrants whose orders may be reinstated and limited the possible relief from a removal order available to them. See Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), § 241(a)(5), 66 Stat. 204, as added by IIRIRA § 305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-599, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5). The questions here are whether the new version of the reinstatement provision is correctly read to apply to individuals who reentered the United States before IIRIRA's effective date, and whether such a reading may be rejected as impermissibly retroactive. We hold the statute applies to those who entered before IIRIRA and does not retroactively affect any right of, or impose any burden on, the continuing violator of the INA now before us. 
I 
In 1950, Congress provided that deportation orders issued against some aliens  who later reentered the United States illegally could be reinstated. 1 Internal Security Act of 1950, § 23(d), 64 Stat. 1012, 8 U.S.C. § 156(d) (1946 ed., Supp. V). 2 Only specific illegal reentrants were subject to the provision,  those deported as "anarchists" or "subversives," for example, see § 23(c), 64 Stat. 1012, while the rest got the benefit of the ordinary deportation rules. Congress retained a reinstatement provision two years later when it revised the immigration laws through the INA, § 242(f), 66 Stat. 212, as codified in this subsection: 
"Should the Attorney General find that any alien has unlawfully reentered the United States after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an order of deportation, whether before or after June 27, 1952, 3 on any ground described . . . in subsection (e) . . ., the  previous order of deportation shall be deemed to be reinstated from its original date and such alien shall be deported under such previous order at any time subsequent to such reentry." 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f) (1994 ed.). 
Again, only a limited class of illegal reentrants was susceptible, see § 242(e) , 66 Stat. 211; cf. § 241(a), id., at 204, and even those affected could seek some varieties of discretionary relief, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.) (suspension of deportation available to aliens who maintained a continuous presence in the United States for seven years and could demonstrate extreme hardship and a good moral character). 
In IIRIRA, Congress replaced this reinstatement provision with one that toed a harder line, as the old § 242(f) was displaced by the new § 241(a)(5): 
"If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply  for any relief under this chapter, and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry." 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) (1994 ed., Supp. III). 
The new law became effective on April 1, 1997, "the first day of the first month beginning more than 180 days after" IIRIRA's enactment. § 309(a), 110 Stat. 3009-625. Unlike its predecessor, § 241(a)(5) applies to all illegal reentrants, explicitly insulates the removal orders from review, and generally forecloses discretionary relief from the terms of the reinstated order. 4 
II 
Humberto Fernandez-Vargas is a citizen of Mexico, who first came to the United States in the 1970s, only to be deported for immigration violations, and to reenter, several times, his last illegal return having been in 1982. Then his luck changed, and for over 20 years he remained undetected in Utah, where he started a trucking business and, in 1989, fathered a son, who is a United States citizen. In 2001, Fernandez-Vargas married the boy's mother, who is also a United States citizen. She soon filed a relative-visa petition on behalf of her husband, see 8 U.S.C. §§ 1154(a), 1151(b) (2000 ed.); see Fernandez-Vargas v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 881, 883, n. 4 (CA10 2005), on the basis of which he filed an application to adjust his status to that of lawful permanent resident, see § 1255(i). The filings apparently tipped off the authorities to his illegal presence here, and in November 2003, the Government began proceedings under § 241(a)(5) that eventuated in reinstating Fernandez-Vargas's 1981 deportation  order, but without the possibility of adjusting his status to lawful residence. He was detained for 10 months before being removed to Juarez, Mexico, in September 2004. 
Fernandez-Vargas petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to review the reinstatement order. He took the position that because he illegally reentered the country before IIRIRA's effective date, the controlling reinstatement provision was the old § 242(f), which meant he was eligible to apply for adjustment of status as spouse of a citizen, and he said that the new § 241(a)(5) would be impermissibly retroactive if it barred his application for adjustment. The Court of Appeals held that § 241(a)(5) did bar Fernandez-Vargas's application and followed Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994), in determining that the new law had no impermissibly retroactive effect in Fernandez-Vargas's case. 394 F.3d at 886, 890-891. We granted certiorari to resolve a split among the Courts of Appeals over the application of § 241(a)(5) to an alien who reentered illegally before IIRIRA's effective date, 5 546 U.S. 975, 126 S. Ct. 544, 163 L. Ed. 2d 458 (2005), and we now affirm. 
III 
Statutes are disfavored as retroactive when their application "would impair rights a party possessed when he  acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed." Landgraf, supra, at 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229. The modern law thus follows Justice Story's definition of a retroactive statute, as "tak away or impair vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creat a new obligation, impos a new duty, or attach a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past," Society for the Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767, F. Cas. No. 13156 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814). Accordingly, it has become "a rule of general application" that "a statute shall not be given retroactive effect unless such construction is required by explicit language or by necessary implication." United States v. St. Louis, S. F. & T. R. Co., 270 U.S. 1, 3, 46 S. Ct. 182, 70 L. Ed. 435, 62 Ct. Cl. 748 (1926) (opinion for the Court by Brandeis, J.). 
This Court has worked out a sequence of analysis when an objection is made to applying a particular statute said to affect a vested right or to impose some burden on the basis of an act or event preceding the statute's enactment. We first look to "whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach," Landgraf, supra, at 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229, and in the absence of language as helpful as that we try to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the temporal reach specifically intended by applying "our normal  rules of construction," Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 326, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481 (1997). If that effort fails, we ask whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of "affecting substantive rights, liabilities, or duties  conduct arising before  enactment," Landgraf, supra, at 278, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229; see also Lindh, supra, at 326, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481. If the answer is yes, we then apply the presumption against retroactivity by construing the statute as inapplicable to the  event or act in question owing to the "absen a clear indication from Congress that it intended such a result." INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 316, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001); see Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 352, 119 S. Ct. 1998, 144 L. Ed. 2d 347 (1999) (quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229). 
Fernandez-Vargas fights at each step of the way, arguing that Congress intended that INA § 241(a)(5) would not apply to illegal reentrants like him who returned to this country before the provision's effective date; and in any event, that application of the provision to such illegal reentrants would have an impermissibly retroactive effect, to be avoided by applying the presumption against it. We are not persuaded by either contention. 6 
A 
Needless to say, Congress did not complement the new version of § 241(a)(5) with any clause expressly dealing with individuals who illegally reentered the country before IIRIRA's April 1, 1997, effective date, either including them within  § 241(a)(5)'s ambit or excluding them from it. Fernandez-Vargas argues instead on the basis of the generally available interpretive rule of negative implication, when he draws attention to language governing temporal reach contained in the old reinstatement provision, but missing from the current one. Section 242(f) applied to "any alien  has unlawfully reentered the United States after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an  order of deportation, whether before or after June 27, 1952, on any ground described in . . . subsection (e)." 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f) (1994 ed.). According to Fernandez-Vargas, since that before-or-after clause made it clear that the statute applied to aliens who reentered before the enactment date of the earlier version, its elimination in the current iteration shows that Congress no longer meant to cover preenactment reentrants. See Brewster v. Gage, 280 U.S. 327, 337, 50 S. Ct. 115, 74 L. Ed. 457, 1930-1 C.B. 274 (1930) ("deliberate selection of language . . . differing from that used in the earlier Acts" can indicate "that a change of law was intended"); cf. 2B N. Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 51.04, p 244 (6th rev.  ed. 2000). But the clues are not that simple. 
To begin with, the old before-or-after clause was sandwiched between references to departure or deportation under a deportation order and to grounds for deportation set out in a different subsection of the INA. It thus most naturally referred not to the illegal reentry but to the alien's previous deportation or departure. If its omission from the new subsection (a)(5) is significant, its immediate significance goes to the date of leaving this country, not the date of illegal return. Since the old clause referred to the date of enactment of the INA in 1952, the negative implication argument from dropping the language is that the reinstatement section no longer applies to those who left the country before that date. But, in 1996, application keyed to departures in 1952 or earlier was academic, and the better inference is that the clause was removed for that reason. 7 
If, moreover, we indulged any suggestion that omitting the clause showed an intent to apply § 241(a)(5) only to deportations or departures after IIRIRA's effective date, the result would be a very strange one: it would exempt from the new  reinstatement provision's coverage anyone who departed before IIRIRA's effective date but reentered after it. The point of the statute's revision, however, was obviously to expand the scope of the reinstatement authority and invest it with something closer to finality, and it would make no sense to infer that Congress meant to except the broad class of persons who had departed before the time of enactment but who might return illegally at some point in the future. 
Fernandez-Vargas sidesteps this problem (on a very generous reading of his argument) by making a more general suggestion of congressional intent: whatever the event to which the old law was tied, activity before as well as activity after it implicated the reinstatement power. Since the new law is bereft of such clarity, we should apply the "'longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien,'" St. Cyr, Supra, at 320, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (quoting INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 449, 107 S. Ct. 1207, 94 L. Ed. 2d 434 (1987)), which would effectively impose "he presumption against retroactive application of ambiguous statutory provisions," St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 320, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347. If we did so, we would find that  § 241(a)(5) operates only to reentries after its effective date. 
Even at this amorphously general level, however, the argument suffers from two flaws, the first being that it puts the cart before the horse. As Fernandez-Vargas realizes, he urges application of the presumption against retroactivity as a tool for interpreting the statute at the first Landgraf step. But if that were legitimate, a statute lacking an express provision about temporal reach would never be construed as having a retroactive potential and the final two steps in the Landgraf enquiry would never occur (that is, asking whether the statute would produce a retroactive effect, and barring any such application by applying the presumption against retroactivity).  It is not until a  statute is shown to have no firm provision about temporal reach but to produce a retroactive effect when straightforwardly applied that the presumption has its work to do. See 511 U.S., at 280, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229. 
The second flaw is the argument's failure to account for the new statute's other provisions on temporal reach, from which one might draw a negative inference that subsection (a)(5) was (or at least may well have been) meant to apply to reentries before its effective date. In contrast to their silence about the temporal sweep of § 241(a)(5), the 1996 amendments speak directly to the scope of changes in provisions making reentry criminal and setting civil penalties. IIRIRA § 324(c), 110 Stat. 3009-629, note following 8 U.S.C. § 1326 (2000 ed.), provides that the expanded criminal prohibitions, see § 1326(a), apply only to reentries or attempts after the effective date, and § 105(b), 110 Stat. 3009-556, note following 8 U.S.C. § 1325, provides the same as to civil penalties for illegal reentry, see § 1325(b). The point here is not that these provisions alone would support an inference of intent to apply the reinstatement provision retroactively, see Lindh, 521 U.S., at 328, n. 4, 117 S. Ct. 2059, 138 L. Ed. 2d 481, for we require a clear statement for that, see Martin, 527 U.S., at 354, 119 S. Ct. 1998, 144 L. Ed. 2d 347. But these provisions do blunt any argument that removal of the before-or-after clause suffices to establish the applicability of § 241(a)(5) only to posteffective date reentries. The fact is that IIRIRA sometimes expressly made changes prospective as from its effective date and sometimes expressly provided they were applicable to earlier acts; compare §§ 324(c) and 105(b) with § 347(c), 110 Stat. 3009-639 (provision governing removal of aliens who have unlawfully voted is applicable "to voting occurring before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act"), and § 351(c), id., at 3009-640 (provision applicable to "waivers filed before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this Act"). With such a variety of treatment, it is just too hard to infer any clear intention at any level of generality from the fact of retiring the old before-or-after language from what is now § 241(a)(5). 
One conclusion can be stated, however.  Common principles of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle the apparent  application of § 241(a)(5) to any reentrant present in the country, whatever the date of return. 8 
B 
This facial reading is confirmed by two features of IIRIRA, not previously discussed, that describe the conduct to which § 241(a)(5) applies, and show that the application suffers from no retroactivity in denying Fernandez-Vargas the opportunity for adjustment of status as the spouse of a citizen of the United States. 9 One is in the text of that provision itself, showing that it applies to Fernandez-Vargas today not because he reentered in 1982 or at any other particular  time, but because he chose to remain after the new statute became effective. The second is the provision setting IIRIRA's effective date, § 309(a), 110 Stat. 3009-625, which shows that Fernandez-Vargas had an ample warning of the coming change in the law, but chose to remain until the old regime expired and § 241(a)(5) took its place. 
As a preface to identifying the conduct by Fernandez-Vargas to which the reinstatement provision applies (the conduct that results in reinstating the old deportation order without the former opportunities to seek adjustment of status), a look at our holding in St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347, is helpful. The alien, St. Cyr, was a lawful, permanent resident who made a plea agreement and pleaded guilty to an aggravated felony charge. Although the resulting conviction justified his deportation, when he entered his plea the law allowed him to seek a waiver of deportation at the discretion of the Attorney General. Between the plea and deportation proceedings, however, IIRIRA and another statute repealed the provision for that discretionary relief, converting deportation from a possibility to a certainty. Id., at 325, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347. The question was whether Landgraf barred application of the new law eliminating discretionary relief, on the ground that applying it to a defendant who pleaded guilty before the enactment of the new law would attach a further burdensome consequence to his plea, amounting to "a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past," 533 U.S., at 321 (internal quotation marks omitted). The answer was that converting deportation from a likely possibility to a dead certainty would add such a burden, and application of the new law was accordingly barred. Id., at 325, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347. In making this "commonsense, functional judgment," Martin, supra, at 357, 119 S. Ct. 1998, 144 L. Ed. 2d 347, we emphasized that plea agreements "involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government," St. Cyr, 533 U.S., at 321,121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347, in which a waiver of "constitutional rights (including the right to a trial)," had been exchanged for a "perceived benefit," id., at  322, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347, which in practical  terms was valued in light of the possible discretionary relief, a focus of expectation and reliance, id., at 323, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347. 
St. Cyr's agreement for a quid pro quo and his plea were entirely past, and there was no question of undoing them, but the "transactio or consideratio" on which § 241(a)(5) turns is different. 10  While the law looks back to a past act in its application to "an alien  has reentered . . . illegally," 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), the provision does not penalize an alien for the reentry (criminal and civil penalties do that); it establishes a process to remove him "under the prior order at any time after the reentry," ibid. Thus, it is the conduct of remaining in the country after entry that is the predicate action; the statute applies to stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien himself could end at any time by voluntarily leaving the country. It is therefore the alien's choice to continue his illegal presence, after illegal reentry and after the effective date of the new law, that subjects him to the new and less generous legal regime, not a past act that he is helpless to undo up to the moment the Government finds him out. 
That in itself is enough to explain that Fernandez-Vargas has no retroactivity claim based on a new disability consequent to a completed act, but in fact his position is weaker still. For Fernandez-Vargas could not only have chosen to end his continuing violation and his exposure to the less favorable law, he even had an ample warning that the new law could be applied to him and ample opportunity to avoid that very possibility by leaving the country and ending his violation in the period between enactment of § 241(a)(5) and its effective date. IIRIRA became law on September 30, 1996, but it became effective and enforceable only on "the first day of the first month beginning more than 180 days after" IIRIRA's enactment, that is, April 1, 1997. § 309(a), 110 Stat. 3009-625. Unlawful alien reentrants like Fernandez-Vargas thus had the advantage of a grace period between the unequivocal warning that a tougher removal regime lay ahead and actual imposition of the less opportune terms of the new law. In that stretch of six months, Fernandez-Vargas could have ended his illegal presence and potential exposure to the coming law by crossing back into Mexico. 11  For that  matter, he could have married the mother of  his son and applied for adjustment of status during that period, in which case he would at least have had a claim (about which we express no opinion) that proven reliance on the old law should be honored by applying the presumption against retroactivity. 12 
Fernandez-Vargas did not, however, take advantage of the statutory warning, but augmented his past 15 years of unlawful presence by remaining in the country into the future subject to the new law, whose applicability thus turned not on the completed act of reentry, but on a failure to take timely action that would have avoided application of the new law altogether. To be sure, a choice to avoid the new law before its effective date or to end the continuing violation thereafter would have come at a high personal price, for Fernandez-Vargas would have had to leave a business and a family he had established during his illegal residence. But the branch of retroactivity law that concerns us here is meant to avoid new burdens imposed on completed acts, not all difficult choices occasioned by new law. What Fernandez-Vargas complains of is the application of new law to continuously illegal action within his control both before and after the new law took effect. He claims a right to continue illegal conduct indefinitely under the terms on which it began, an entitlement of legal stasis for those whose lawbreaking is continuous. But "f every time a man relied on existing law in arranging his affairs, he were made secure against any change in legal rules, the whole body of our law would be ossified forever." L. Fuller, The Morality of Law 60 (1964) (quoted in Landgraf, 511 U.S., at 270, n. 24, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229). 13 
Because we conclude that § 241(a)(5) has no retroactive effect  when applied to aliens like Fernandez-Vargas, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. 
It is so ordered.

DISSENT 
Justice Stevens, dissenting. 
In 1982, petitioner Humberto Fernandez-Vargas, an alien who had previously been deported, reentered the United States illegally. Over the next 20 years, petitioner remained here. He worked as a truckdriver, owned a trucking business, fathered a child, and eventually married the child's mother, a United States citizen. The laws in place at the time of petitioner's entry and for the first 15 years of his residence in this country would have rewarded this behavior, allowing him to seek discretionary relief from deportation on the basis of his continued presence in and strong ties to the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.). 
In 1996, however, Congress passed a new version of the applicable provision eliminating almost entirely the possibility of relief from deportation for aliens who reenter the country  illegally having previously been deported. See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRIRA or Act), § 305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-599 , 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) (2000 ed.); see also ante, at ____, n 4, 165 L. Ed. 2d, at 333. The 1996 provision is silent as to whether it was intended to apply retroactively to conduct that predated its enactment. 1 Despite a historical practice supporting petitioner's reading, and despite the harsh consequences that attend its application to thousands of individuals who, like petitioner, entered the country illegally before 1997, the Court not only holds that the statute applies to preenactment reentries but also that it has no retroactive effect. I disagree with both of these conclusions. 
I 
In 1950, when Congress first gave the Attorney General the authority to reinstate an order of deportation, it enacted a reinstatement provision containing no explicit temporal reach. 2 See Internal Security Act, § 23(d), 64 Stat. 1012, 8 U.S.C. § 156(d) (1946 ed., Supp. V). The natural reading of this provision, the one most consistent with the "deeply rooted" traditional presumption against retroactivity, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 265, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1994), is that it would apply to deportations that occurred before the provision's enactment but not to preenactment reentries. While both deportation and reentry can constitute "events completed before  enactment,"  id., at 270, 114 S. Ct. 1483, 128 L. Ed. 2d 229, an  alien's reentry is the act that triggers the provision's operation and is therefore the act to which the provision attaches legal consequences. 
When the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) promulgated regulations implementing the 1950 statute, however, it did not read the statute so naturally. Instead, the INS' regulations,  embodying an overly strong version of the presumption against retroactivity, provided that an order of deportation could only be reinstated if that deportation occurred after the statute's enactment date. See 8 CFR § 152.5 (1950 Cum. Supp.). Thus, the INS read the reinstatement provision as inapplicable even to reentries that occurred after the statute's enactment date if the underlying deportation had been entered before that date; it follows a fortiori that the provision was considered inapplicable to reentries that occurred before the statute's enactment. 
Congress corrected the INS' error two years later by adding the clause "whether before or after the date of enactment of this Act." Immigration and Nationality Act, § 242(f), 66 Stat. 212, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f) (1994 ed.); see also ante, at ____, and nn 2-3, 165 L. Ed. 2d, at 332. As the Court correctly notes, that amendment "most naturally referred not to the illegal reentry but to the alien's previous deportation or departure. " Ante, at ____, 165 L. Ed. 2d, at 336. The best interpretation of Congress' intent with regard to the 1952 statute, then, was that it meant to apply the reinstatement provision to preenactment deportations but to preserve the status quo with regard to preenactment reentries: In accordance with the traditional presumption against retroactivity, pre-enactment reentries would remain uncovered by the reinstatement provision. 
In 1996, when Congress enacted the current reinstatement provision, it drafted a version of the statute that, like its 1950 predecessor, was silent as to its temporal reach. See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5) (2000 ed.). If we assume (as the Court does) that the addition of the "before-or-after" clause in the 1952 statute merely clarified Congress' original intent in  1950 to make the provision applicable to preenactment departures without authorizing any application to preenactment reentries, it is reasonable to attribute precisely the same intent to the Congress that enacted the 1996 statute: As in the 1950 and 1952 versions of the provision, Congress intended the 1996 reinstatement provision to apply to preenactment deportations but not to preenactment reentries. 
In sum, our normal rules of construction support the reasonable presumption that Congress intended the provision to cover only postenactment reentries. Accordingly, the 1996 reinstatement provision should not be construed to apply to petitioner's earlier entry into the United States. 
II 
The Court not only fails to give the 1996 Act its most normal interpretation, but also erroneously concludes that the provision does not have any retroactive effect. The Court reaches this conclusion based on its judgment that the provision applies not to conduct that occurred before the statute's enactment date, but rather to "an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien himself could end at any time by voluntarily leaving the country." Ante, at ____, 165 L. Ed. 2d, at 339. This reasoning is unpersuasive. 
It is true, of course, that the order of deportation entered against petitioner in 1981 could not be reinstated unless he was present in the United States, and that, until he was arrested in 2003, petitioner could have chosen to leave the United States. But it is precisely petitioner's "continuing violation" that allowed him to be eligible for relief from deportation in the first place: He was required to have been physically present in the United States for a period of not less than seven years, to have been a person of good moral character during that time, and to have developed ties to the United States such that his deportation would result in extreme hardship to himself or to his United  States citizen  wife or child. 3 See 8 U.S.C. § 1254(a)(1) (1994 ed.); see also INS v. Phinpathya, 464 U.S. 183, 104 S. Ct. 584, 78 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1984) (strictly construing physical presence requirement). Moreover, under the pre-1996 version of the reinstatement provision, the longer petitioner remained in the United States the more likely he was to be granted relief from deportation. See Matter of Ige, 20 I. & N. Dec. 880, 882 (1994) (listing factors considered in evaluating extreme hardship requirement, including alien's length of residence in United States, family in United States, business or occupation, and position in community). 
Given these incentives, petitioner legitimately complains that the Government has changed the rules midgame. At the time of his entry, and for the next 15 years, it inured to petitioner's benefit for him to remain in the United States continuously, to build a business, and to start a family. After April 1, 1997, the date on which the applicable reinstatement provision became effective, all of these activities were rendered irrelevant in the eyes of the law. Only the Court's unfortunately formalistic search for a single "past act that  is helpless to undo," ante, at ____, 165 L. Ed. 2d, at 339, allows it to conclude that the provision at issue has no retroactive effect. 4 For regardless of whether his 1982 reentry was or  was not an act that he could now "undo," it is certainly an act to which the 1996 reinstatement provision has attached serious adverse consequences. Because the provision has an undeniably harsh retroactive effect, "absent a clear indication from Congress that it intended such a result," INS v. St.  Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 316, 121 S. Ct. 2271, 150 L. Ed. 2d 347 (2001), we should apply the presumption against retroactivity and hold that the 1996 reinstatement provision does not apply to petitioner. 
Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
