OPINION
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a physician who is under contract with the State to provide medical services to inmates at a state-prison hospital on a part-time basis acts "under color of state law," within the meaning of 42 U. S.  C. § 1983, when he treats an inmate.
I
Petitioner, Quincy West, tore his left Achilles tendon in 1983 while playing volleyball at Odom Correctional Center, the Jackson, N. C., state prison in which he was incarcerated. A physician under contract to provide medical care to Odom inmates examined petitioner and directed that he be transferred to Raleigh for orthopedic consultation at Central Prison Hospital, the acute-care medical facility operated by the State for its more than 17,500 inmates. Central Prison Hospital has one full-time staff physician, and obtains additional medical assistance under "Contracts for Professional Services" between the State and area physicians.
Respondent, Samuel Atkins, M. D., a private physician, provided orthopedic services to inmates pursuant to one such contract.  Under it, Doctor Atkins was paid approximately $ 52,000 annually to operate two "clinics" each week at Central Prison Hospital, with additional amounts for surgery. 1 Over a period of several months, he treated West's injury by placing his leg in a series of casts.  West alleges that although the doctor acknowledged that surgery would be necessary, he refused to schedule it, and that he eventually  discharged West while his ankle was still swollen and painful, and his movement still impeded.  Because West was a prisoner in "close custody," he was not free to employ or elect to see a different physician of his own choosing. 2
Pursuant to 42 U. S. C. § 1983, 3 West, proceeding pro se, commenced this action against Doctor Atkins 4 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina for violation of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. 5 West alleged that Atkins was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, by failing to provide adequate treatment.
Relying on a decision of its controlling court in Calvert v. Sharp, 748 F. 2d 861 (CA4 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1132 (1985), the District Court granted Doctor Atkins' motion for summary judgment.  In Calvert, the Fourth Circuit held that a private orthopedic specialist, employed by a nonprofit professional corporation which provided  services under contract to the inmates at the Maryland House of Corrections and the Maryland Penitentiary, did not act "under color of state law," a jurisdictional requisite for a § 1983 action. Because Doctor Atkins was a "contract physician," the District Court concluded that he, too, was not acting under color of state law when he treated West's injury.  App. 37.
A panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated the District Court's judgment.  799 F. 2d 923 (1986). Rather than considering if Calvert could be distinguished, the panel remanded the case to the District Court for an assessment whether the record permitted a finding of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, a showing necessary for West ultimately to prevail on his Eighth Amendment claim.  See Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976).
On en banc rehearing, however, a divided Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's dismissal of West's complaint.  815 F. 2d 993 (1987). In declining to overrule its decision in Calvert, the majority concluded:
"Thus the clear and practicable principle enunciated by the Supreme Court  454 U.S. 312 (1981)],   and followed  in Calvert, is that a professional, when acting within the bounds of traditional professional discretion and judgment, does not act under color of state law, even where, as in Dodson, the professional is a full-time employee of the state.  Where the professional exercises custodial or supervisory authority, which is to say that he is not acting in his professional capacity, then a § 1983 claim can be established, provided the requisite nexus to the state is proved." 815 F. 2d, at 995 (footnote omitted).
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that this rule limits "the range of   professionals subject to an Estelle action." Ibid. 6
The dissent in the Court of Appeals offered three grounds for holding that service rendered by a prison  doctor -- whether a permanent member of a prison medical staff, or under limited contract with the prison -- constitutes action under color of state law for purposes of § 1983.  First, the dissent concluded that prison doctors are as much "state actors" as are other prison employees, finding no significant difference between Doctor Atkins and the physician-employees assumed to be state actors in Estelle, and in O'Connor v. Donaldson, 422 U.S. 563 (1975). See 815 F. 2d, at 997-998. Second, the dissent concluded that the "public function" rationale applied because, in the prison context, medical care is within "the exclusive prerogative of the State," in that the State is obligated to provide medical services for its inmates and has complete control over the circumstances and sources of a prisoner's medical treatment. Id., at 998-999, citing Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1011 (1982). Finally, the dissent reasoned that the integral role the prison physician plays within the prison medical system qualifies his actions as under color of state law. 815 F. 2d, at 999, citing United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 794 (1966) ("illful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents"  may be liable under § 1983); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 931-932 (1982); and Tower v. Glover, 467 U.S. 914 (1984).
The Fourth Circuit's ruling conflicts with decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, Ancata v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 769 F. 2d 700 (1985), and Ort v. Pinchback, 786 F. 2d 1105 (1986), which are to the effect that a physician who contracts with the State to provide medical care to prison inmates, even if employed by a private entity, acts under color of state law for purposes of § 1983. 7 We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict. 484 U.S. 912 (1987).
II
To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 535 (1981) (overruled in part on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 330-331 (1986));Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S. 149, 155 (1978).Petitioner West sought to fulfill the first requirement by alleging a violation of his rights secured by the Eighth Amendment under Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976). There the Court held that   deliberate indifference to a prisoner's serious medical needs, whether by a prison doctor or a prison guard, is prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Id., at 104-105. The adequacy of West's allegation and the sufficiency of his showing on this element of his § 1983 cause of action are not contested here. 8 The only issue before   us is whether petitioner has established the second essential element -- that respondent acted under color of state law in treating West's injury.
A
The traditional definition of acting under color of state law requires that the defendant in a § 1983 action have exercised power "possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law." United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 326 (1941).Accord, Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187 (1961) (adopting Classic standard for purposes of § 1983) (overruled in part on other grounds, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 695-701 (1978)); Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 317-318 (1981); id., at 329 (dissenting opinion).  In Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., supra, the Court made clear that if a defendant's conduct satisfies the state-action requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, "that conduct  also action under color of state law and will support a suit under § 1983." Id., at 935. Accord, Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 838 (1982); United States v. Price, 383 U.S., at 794, n. 7. In such circumstances, the defendant's alleged infringement of the plaintiff's federal rights is "fairly attributable to the State." Lugar, 457 U.S., at 937.
To constitute state action,   "the deprivation  must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State . . . or by a person for whom the State is responsible," and "the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor." Ibid. "tate employment is generally sufficient to render the defendant a state actor." Id., at 936, n. 18; see id., at 937.It is firmly established that   a defendant in a § 1983 suit acts under color of state law when he abuses the position given to him by the State.  See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S., at 172. Thus, generally,   a public employee acts under color of state law while acting in his official capacity or while exercising his responsibilities pursuant to state law. See, e. g., Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S., at 535-536; Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 152 (1970). See also Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks, 436 U.S., at 157, n. 5.
Indeed, Polk County v. Dodson, relied upon by the Court of Appeals, is the only case in which this Court has determined that a person who is employed by the State and who is sued under § 1983 for abusing his position in the performance of his assigned tasks was not acting under color  of state law. The Court held that "a public defender does not act under color of state law when performing a lawyer's traditional functions as counsel to a defendant in a criminal proceeding." 454 U.S., at 325. In this capacity, the Court noted, a public defender differs from the typical government employee and state actor. While performing his duties, the public defender retains all of the essential attributes of a private attorney, including, most importantly, his "professional independence," which the State is constitutionally obliged to respect.  Id., at 321-322. A criminal lawyer's professional and ethical obligations require him to act in a role independent of and in opposition to the State.  Id., at 318-319, 320. The Court accordingly concluded that when representing an indigent defendant in a state criminal proceeding, the public defender does not act under color of state law for purposes of § 1983 because he "is not acting on behalf of the State; he is the State's adversary." Id., at 323, n. 13. See also Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S., at 936, n. 18.
B
We disagree with the Court of Appeals and respondent that Polk County dictates a conclusion that respondent did not act under  color of state law in providing medical treatment to petitioner.  In contrast to the public defender, Doctor Atkins' professional and ethical obligation to make independent medical judgments did not set him in conflict with the State and other prison authorities.  Indeed, his relationship with other prison authorities was cooperative.  "Institutional physicians assume an obligation to the mission that the State, through the institution, attempts to achieve." Polk County, 454 U.S., at 320. The Manual governing prison health care in North Carolina's institutions, which Doctor Atkins was required to observe, declares: "The provision of health care is a joint effort of correctional administrators and health care providers, and can be achieved only through mutual trust and cooperation." 9 Similarly, the American Medical Association Standards for Health Services in Prisons (1979) provide that medical personnel and other prison officials are to act in "close cooperation and coordination" in a "joint effort." Preface, at i; Standard 102, and Discussion.  Doctor Atkins' professional obligations certainly did not oblige him to function as "the State's adversary." Polk County, 454 U.S., at 323, n. 13.  We thus find the proffered analogy between respondent and the public defender in Polk County unpersuasive.
Of course, the Court of Appeals did not perceive the adversarial role the defense lawyer plays in our criminal justice system as the decisive factor in the Polk County decision.  The court, instead, appears to have misread Polk County as establishing the general principle that professionals do not act under color of state law when they act in their professional capacities.  The court considered a professional not to be subject to suit under § 1983 unless he was exercising "custodial or supervisory" authority.  815 F. 2d, at 995. To the extent this Court in Polk County relied on the fact that the public defender is a "professional" in concluding   that he was not engaged in state action, the case turned on the particular professional obligation of the criminal defense attorney to be an adversary of the State, not on the independence and integrity generally applicable to professionals as a class.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals' reading would be inconsistent with cases, decided  before and since Polk County, in which this Court either has identified professionals as state actors, see, e. g., Tower v. Glover, 467 U.S. 914 (1984) (state public defenders), or has assumed that professionals are state actors in § 1983 suits, see, e. g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976) (medical director of state prison who was also the treating physician).  See also Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 322-323, and n. 30 (1982) (establishing standards to determine whether decisions of "professional" regarding treatment of involuntarily committed can create liability for a due process violation). Defendants are not removed from the purview of § 1983 simply because they are professionals acting in accordance with professional discretion and judgment. 10
The Court of Appeals' approach to determining who is subject to suit under § 1983, wholeheartedly embraced by respondent, cannot be reconciled with this Court's decision in Estelle, which demonstrates that custodial and supervisory functions are irrelevant to an assessment whether the particular action challenged was performed under color of state law. In Estelle, the inmate's Eighth Amendment claim was brought against the physician-employee, Dr. Gray, in his capacity both as treating physician and as medical director of the state prison system.  See 429 U.S., at 107. Gray was sued, however, solely on the basis of allegedly substandard medical treatment given to the plaintiff; his supervisory and custodial functions were not at issue.  The Court's opinion did not suggest that Gray had not acted under color of state law in treating the inmate. 11 To the contrary, the   inference to be drawn from Estelle is that   the medical treatment of prison inmates by prison physicians is state action. The Court explicitly held that "indifference . . . manifested by prison doctors in their response to the prisoner's needs . . . states a cause of action under § 1983." Id., at 104-105; see id.,  at 104, n. 10 (citing with approval Courts of Appeals' decisions holding prison doctors liable for Eighth Amendment claims brought under § 1983 without mention of supervisory and custodial duties).  The Court of Appeals' rationale would sharply undermine this holding. 12
C
We now make explicit what was implicit in our holding in Estelle: Respondent, as   a physician employed by North Carolina to provide medical services to state prison inmates, acted under color of state law for purposes of § 1983 when undertaking his duties in treating petitioner's injury.  Such conduct is fairly attributable to the State.
The Court recognized in Estelle: "An inmate must rely on prison authorities to treat his medical needs; if the authorities fail to do so, those needs will not be met." 429 U.S., at 103. In light of this, the Court held that the State has a constitutional obligation, under the Eighth Amendment, to provide adequate medical care to those whom it has incarcerated. Id., at 104. See also Spicer v. Williamson, 191 N. C. 487, 490, 132 S. E. 291, 293 (1926) (common law requires   North Carolina  to provide medical care to its prison inmates), cited in Estelle, 429 U.S., at 104, n. 9. North Carolina employs physicians, such as respondent, and defers to their professional judgment, in order to fulfill this obligation.  By virtue of this relationship, effected by state law, Doctor Atkins is authorized and obliged to treat prison inmates, such as West. 13 He does so "clothed with the authority of state law." United States v. Classic, 313 U.S., at 326. He is "a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor." Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S., at 937. It is only those physicians authorized by the State to whom the inmate may turn.  Under state law, the only medical care West could receive for his injury was that provided by the State.  If Doctor Atkins misused his power by demonstrating deliberate indifference to West's serious medical needs, the resultant deprivation was caused, in the sense relevant for state-action inquiry, by the State's exercise of its right to punish West by incarceration and to deny him a venue independent of the State to obtain needed medical care.
The fact that the State   employed respondent pursuant to a contractual arrangement that did not generate the same benefits or obligations applicable to other "state employees" does not alter the analysis. It is the physician's function within the state system, not the precise terms of his employment, that determines whether his actions can fairly be attributed to the State.  Whether a physician is on the state payroll or is paid by contract, the dispositive issue concerns the relationship among the State, the physician, and the prisoner. Contracting out prison medical care does not relieve the State of its constitutional duty to provide adequate medical treatment to those in its custody, and it does not deprive the State's prisoners of the means to vindicate their Eighth Amendment rights. 14 The State bore an affirmative obligation to provide adequate medical care to West; the State delegated that function to respondent Atkins; and respondent voluntarily assumed that obligation by contract.
Nor does the fact that Doctor Atkins' employment contract did not require him to work exclusively for the prison make him any less a state actor than if he performed those duties as a full-time, permanent member of the state prison medical staff. It is the physician's function while working for the State, not the amount of time he spends in performance of those duties or the fact that he may be employed by others to perform similar duties, that determines whether he is acting under color of state law. 15 In the State's employ,   respondent worked as a physician at the prison hospital fully vested with state authority to fulfill essential aspects of the duty, placed on the State by the Eighth Amendment and state law, to provide essential medical care to those the State had incarcerated. Doctor Atkins must be considered to be a state actor.
III
For the reasons stated above, we conclude that respondent's delivery of medical treatment to West was state action fairly attributable to the State, and that respondent therefore acted under color of state law for purposes of § 1983.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: SCALIA (In Part)
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the opinion of the Court that respondent acted under color of state law for purposes of § 1983.  I do not believe that a doctor who lacks supervisory or other penological duties can inflict "punishment" within the meaning of that term in the Eighth Amendment. Cf.  Johnson v. Glick, 481 F. 2d 1028, 1031-1032 (CA2) (Friendly, J.), cert. denied sub nom.  John v. Johnson, 414 U.S. 1033 (1973). I am also of the view, however, that a physician who acts on behalf of the State to provide needed medical attention to a person involuntarily in state custody (in prison or elsewhere) and prevented from otherwise obtaining it, and who causes physical harm to such a person by deliberate indifference, violates the Fourteenth  Amendment's protection against the deprivation of liberty without due process.  See Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 315, 324 (1982) (dictum); see generally Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986); Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S. 651, 672-674, and n. 41 (1977); Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 169-174 (1952); Johnson, supra, at 1032-1033 . I note that petitioner's pro se complaint merely claimed violation of his rights, and it is the courts that have specified which constitutional provision confers those rights.
