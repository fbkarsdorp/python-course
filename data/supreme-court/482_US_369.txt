OPINION
JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether respondents have a liberty interest in parole release that is protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
I
Respondents are George Allen and Dale Jacobsen, inmates of the Montana State Prison. 1 In 1984, after their applications for parole were denied, they filed this action pursuant to 42 U. S. C. § 1983 on behalf of a class of all present and future inmates of the Montana State Prison who were or might become eligible for parole. Seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory damages, the complaint charged the State Board of Pardons (Board) and its Chair with violations of the inmates' civil rights. Specifically, respondents alleged that the Board does not apply the statutorily mandated criteria in determining inmates' eligibility for parole, Complaint paras. 6-9, App. 5a-6a, and that the Board does not adequately explain its reasons for denial of parole, id., paras. 9, 10, App. 6a. 2
The District Court first acknowledged that the case was controlled by the principles established in this Court's decision in Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1 (1979). In Greenholtz the Court held that, despite the necessarily subjective and predictive nature of the parole-release decision, see id., at 12, state statutes may create liberty interests in parole release that are entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause.  The Court concluded that the mandatory language and the structure of the Nebraska statute at   issue in Greenholtz created an "expectancy of release," which is a liberty interest entitled to such protection.  Ibid.
Although the District Court recognized that the Montana statute, like the Nebraska statute in Greenholtz, contained language mandating release under certain circumstances, it decided that respondents "were not entitled to due process protections in connection with the board's denial of parole." App. 17a. The court concluded that, because the Board is required to make determinations with respect to the best interest of the community and the prisoner, its discretion is too broad to provide a prisoner with a liberty interest in parole release.
The Court of Appeals reversed.  It compared the provisions of the Montana statute to those of the Nebraska statute in Greenholtz and found their structure and language virtually indistinguishable:
"The Montana statute, like the Nebraska statute at issue in Greenholtz, uses mandatory language. It states that the Board 'shall' release a prisoner on parole when it determines release would not be harmful, unless specified conditions exist that would preclude parole. There is no doubt that it, like the Nebraska provision in Greenholtz, vests great discretion in the Board.  Under both statutes the Board must make difficult and highly subjective decisions about risks of releasing inmates. However, the Board may not deny parole under either statute once it determines that harm is not probable." 792 F.2d 1404, 1406 (CA9 1986).
The court thus held that respondents had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted, and remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of "the nature of the process which is due " and "whether Montana's present procedures accord that due process." Id., at 1408.
We granted certiorari, 479 U.S. 947 (1986), and now affirm.
II
Greenholtz set forth two major holdings.  The Court first held that   the presence of a parole system by itself does not give rise to a constitutionally protected liberty interest in parole release. 3 The Court also held,   however, that the Nebraska statute did create an "expectation of parole" protected by the Due Process Clause.  442 U.S., at 11. To decide whether the Montana statute also gives rise to a constitutionally protected liberty interest, we scrutinize it under the standards set forth in Greenholtz.
The Nebraska statute involved in Greenholtz provides as follows:
"Whenever the Board of Parole considers the release of a committed offender who is eligible for release on parole, it shall order his release unless it is of the opinion that his release should be deferred because:
"(a) There is a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole;
"(b) His release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law;
"(c) His release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline; or
"(d) His continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility will substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later date." Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-1,114(1) (1981) (emphasis added).
The statute also sets forth a list of 14 factors (including one catchall factor permitting the Nebraska Board to consider other information it deems relevant) that the Board must consider in reaching a decision.  §§ 83-1,114(2)(a)-(n).
In deciding that this statute created a constitutionally protected liberty interest, the Court found significant its mandatory  language -- the use of the word "shall" -- and the presumption created -- that parole release must be granted unless one of four designated justifications for deferral is found.  See Greenholtz, 442 U.S., at 11-12. 4
The Court recognized -- indeed highlighted -- that parole-release decisions are inherently subjective and predictive, see id., at 12, but nonetheless found that Nebraska inmates possessed a liberty interest in release.  The Court observed that parole release is an equity-type judgment involving "a synthesis of record facts and personal observation filtered through the experience of the decisionmaker and leading to a predictive judgment as to what is best both for the individual inmate and for the community," id., at 8, 5 and acknowledged that the Nebraska statute, like most parole statutes, "vest very broad discretion in the Board," id., at 13.  Nevertheless, the Court rejected the Board's argument "that a presumption  would be created only if the statutory conditions for deferral were essentially factual, . . . rather than predictive." Id., at 12.
The Court thus held in Greenholtz that   the presence of general  or broad release criteria -- delegating significant discretion to the decisionmaker -- did not deprive the prisoner of the liberty interest in parole release created by the Nebraska statute.  In essence, the Court made a distinction between two entirely distinct uses of the term discretion.  In one sense of the word, an official has discretion when he or she "is simply not bound by standards set by the authority in question." R. Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously 32 (1977).  In this sense, officials who have been told to parole whomever they wish have discretion.  In Greenholtz, the Court determined that a scheme awarding officials this type of discretion does not create a liberty interest in parole release. But the term discretion may instead signify that "an official must use judgment in applying the standards set him  by authority"; in other words, an official has discretion when the standards set by a statutory or regulatory scheme "cannot be applied mechanically." Dworkin, supra, at 31, 32; see also id., at 69 ("We say that a man has discretion if his duty is   defined by standards that reasonable  can interpret in different ways"). The Court determined in Greenholtz that   the presence of official discretion in this sense is not incompatible with the existence of a liberty interest in parole release when release is required after the Board determines (in its broad discretion) that the necessary prerequisites exist.
Throughout this litigation, the Board's arguments have had a single theme: that the holding of the Court of Appeals is inconsistent with our decision in Greenholtz. 6 The Board is mistaken. The Montana   statute, like the Nebraska statute, creates a liberty interest in parole release. It provides in pertinent part:
"Prisoners eligible for parole. (1) Subject to the following restrictions, the board shall release on parole . . . any person confined in the Montana state prison or the women's correction center . . . when in its opinion there is reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment   to the prisoner or to the community
. . . .
"(2) A parole shall be ordered only for the best interests of society and not as an award of clemency or a reduction of sentence or pardon.  A prisoner shall be placed on parole only when the board believes that he is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen." Mont. Code Ann. § 46-23-201 (1985) (emphasis added). 7
Significantly, the Montana statute, like the Nebraska statute, uses mandatory language ("shall") 8 to "creat a presumption that parole release will be granted" when the designated findings are made.  Greenholtz, 442 U.S., at 12.9 See   Statement of Assistant Attorney General of Montana, Tr. of Oral Arg. 6 ("under our statute once the Board of Pardons determines that the facts underlying a particular parole application are such that the release can occur consistently with the three criteria the statute specifies, then under our law the Board is required to order release").  We reject the argument that a statute that mandates release "unless" certain findings are made is different from a statute that mandates release "if," "when," or "subject to" such findings being made.  Any such statute "creates a presumption that parole release will be granted." Greenholtz, supra, at 12.10
Moreover, the "substantive predicates," see Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 472 (1983), of parole release in Montana are similar to those in Nebraska.  In both States, the Parole Board must assess the impact of release on both the prisoner and the community.  A central concern of each is the prisoner's ability "to lead a law-abiding life." Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-1,114(1)(d) (1981); see § 83-1,114(1)(a) (prisoner may not be released if there is "a substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole"); Mont. Code Ann. § 46-23-201(2) (1985) (prisoner must be released when, inter alia, it will cause no detriment to him or her and must not be released unless the prisoner is "able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen").  An interrelated concern of both statutes is whether the release can be achieved without "detriment to . . . the community." Mont. Code Ann. § 46-23-201(1) (1985); see § 46-23-201(2) (prisoner must be released only "for the best interests of society"); see Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-1,114(1)(b) (1981) (prisoner must not be released if it "would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect for law").  The discretion left with the parole boards is equivalent in Montana and Nebraska.
The legislative history further supports the conclusion that this statute places significant limits on the discretion of the Board.  The statute was enacted in 1955, replacing a 1907 statute which had granted absolute discretion to the Board:
"Parole of prisoners in State Prison. -- The Governor may recommend and the State Board of Prison Commissioners may parole any inmate of the State Prison, under such reasonable conditions and regulations as may be deemed expedient, and adopted by such state board." Mont. Rev. Code § 9573 (1907).
The new statute made release mandatory upon certain findings and specified its purpose in its title: "An Act Creating a Board of Pardons and Prescribing the Appointment and Composition Thereof, With Power and Duty to Grant Paroles,   Within Restrictions . . . ." Act of Mar. 3, 1955, 1955 Mont. Laws, ch. 153 (emphasis added).  The new statute also added a provision for judicial review of the Board's parole-release decisions, see Mont. Code Ann. § 46-23-107 (1985), thus providing a further indication of a legislative intent to cabin the discretion of the Board.
Here, as in Greenholtz, the release decision is "necessarily subjective . . . and predictive," see 442 U.S., at 13; here, as in Greenholtz, the discretion of the Board is "very broad," see ibid.; and here, as in Greenholtz, the Board shall release the inmate when the findings prerequisite to release are made. See supra, at 377-378 and 379-380.  Thus, we find in the Montana statute, as in the Nebraska statute, a liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

DISSENT BY: O'CONNOR
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and JUSTICE SCALIA join, dissenting.
Relying on semantics and ignoring altogether the sweeping discretion granted to the Board of Pardons by Montana law, the Court today concludes that respondents had a legitimate expectation of parole sufficient to give rise to an interest protected by procedural due process.  Because I conclude that the discretion accorded the Board of Pardons belies any reasonable claim of entitlement to parole, I respectfully dissent.
In Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564 (1972), this Court observed that to have a protected interest, one "clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for it.  He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.  He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it." Id., at 577. Applying these principles, the Roth Court found that a teacher had no property interest in a renewal of his 1-year contract despite the fact that most teachers hired on a year-to-year basis by the university were rehired.  Id., at 578, n. 16. The Court concluded that the teacher had no legitimate entitlement to continued employment because the discretion of the university officials to renew or not renew such a contract was subject to no "cause" limitations.
The Roth decision teaches that a mere expectation of a benefit -- even if that expectation is supported by consistent government practice -- is not sufficient to create an interest protected by procedural due process.  Instead, the statute at issue must create an entitlement to the benefit before procedural due process rights are triggered.  In my view, the distinction between an "entitlement" and a mere "expectancy" must necessarily depend on the degree to which the decisionmakers' discretion is constrained by law.  An individual simply has nothing more than a mere hope of receiving a benefit unless the decision to confer that benefit is in a real sense channeled by law.  Because the crucial inquiry in determining the creation of a protected interest is whether a statutory entitlement is created, it cannot be sufficient merely to point to the existence of some "standard." Instead, to give rise to a protected liberty interest, the statute must act to limit meaningfully the discretion of the decisionmakers. In the administrative law context we have long recognized that some purported standards "'are drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.'" Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971) (quoting S. Rep. No. 752, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1945)).  Accordingly, we have held that some agency action is committed to agency discretion within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act; as a result, agency action is not subject to judicial review if "no judicially manageable standards are available for judging how and when an agency should exercise its discretion." Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985). It is no less critical in determining whether a statute creates a protected liberty interest to consider whether the statute includes standards that place real limits on decisionmaker discretion.
Under our precedents, an entitlement is created by statute only if "particularized standards or criteria" constrain the relevant decisionmakers. Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U.S. 458, 467   (1981) (BRENNAN, J., concurring).  In Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215 (1976), for example, we concluded that a state statute did not create a liberty interest in remaining in a particular penal facility because that statute "conferred no right on the prisoner to remain in the prison to which he was initially assigned, defeasible only upon proof of specific acts of misconduct." Id., at 226 (emphasis added).  The broad discretion granted prison officials to make transfer decisions negated any claim to the creation of a liberty interest:
"A prisoner's behavior may precipitate a transfer; and absent such behavior, perhaps transfer would not take place at all.  But, as we have said, Massachusetts prison officials have the discretion to transfer prisoners for any number of reasons.  Their discretion is not limited to instances of serious misconduct.  As we understand it no legal interest or right of these respondents under Massachusetts law would have been violated by their transfer whether or not their misconduct had been proved in accordance with procedures that might be required by the Due Process Clause in other circumstances.  Whatever expectation the prisoner may have in remaining at a particular prison so long as he behaves himself, it is too ephemeral and insubstantial to trigger procedural due process protections as long as prison officials have discretion to transfer him for whatever reason or for no reason at all." Id., at 228.
See also Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 249 (1983) (" State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion"); Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 472 (1983) (observing that the statute in question provided "explicitly mandatory language in connection with requiring specific substantive predicates") (emphasis added); Montanye v. Haymes , 427 U.S. 236, 243 (1976) (no liberty interest in remaining in particular facility created by state law because state law did not limit t   transfer only on the occurrence of misconduct); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557 (1974) ("The State itself has not only provided a statutory right to good time but also specifies that it is to be forfeited only for serious misbehavior").
Although paying lipservice to the principle that a statute creates an entitlement sufficient to trigger due process protections only when the decisionmakers' discretion is limited by standards, the Court today utterly fails to consider whether the purported "standards" meaningfully constrain the discretion of state officials.  Even a cursory examination of the Montana statute reveals that the Board of Pardons is subject to no real restraint, and that the standards are anything but "particularized." In sharp contrast to the statute at issue in Wolff v. McDonnell, supra, and like the statutes at issue in Meachum v. Fano, supra, and Montanye v. Haymes, supra, the Montana statute does not require specific acts of misconduct before the Board may deny parole. Instead, the Board may deny parole when it determines: that there is not a "reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community," Mont. Code Ann. § 46-23-201(1) (1985); that parole is not in "the best interests of society," § 46-23-201(2); or that the Board believes that the prisoner is not "able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen." Ibid.  An appellate court reviewing the decision of the Board that the release of a prisoner would not be "in the best interests of society" or would be "detriment . . . to the community" would have little or no basis for taking issue with the judgment of the Board.  These broadly framed standards essentially leave the decision whether or not to grant release on parole to the discretion of the Board, and therefore the statute simply fails to create a legitimate entitlement to release.  See Herman, The New Liberty: The Procedural Due Process Rights of Prisoners and Others Under the Burger Court, 59 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 482, 550 (1984)  ("A parole statute providing   that parole shall be granted unless the prospective parolee 'poses a danger to society' is not significantly different from one under which the parole board's decisions are nonreviewable, since a court would be unlikely to reverse a parole board decision made under such a discretionary standard").
Admittedly, the statute at issue in Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1 (1979), did not offer "particularized" standards, and did not significantly restrain the parole decision.  Greenholtz is thus an aberration and should be reexamined and limited strictly to its facts.  Nonetheless, in marked contrast to the Montana statute, at least the Nebraska statute limited to some degree the scope of the factors that parole officials could consider dispositive in granting or denying release on parole. While the Montana statute permits denial of parole when the prisoner's release is not in "the best interests of society" or is "detriment to the prisoner or to the community," the Nebraska statute permits consideration only of four more focused factors: (1) whether "there is a substantial risk that  will not conform to the conditions of parole," (2) whether the "release would depreciate the seriousness of  crime or promote disrespect for law," (3) whether the "release would have a substantially adverse effect on institutional discipline," and (4) whether the prisoner's "continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility will substantially enhance  capacity to lead a law-abiding life." Neb. Rev. Stat. § 83-1,114(1) (1981).  Therefore, the result in this case is not compelled by Greenholtz, even assuming that case was correctly decided.
In sum, the Court has abandoned the essential inquiry in determining whether a statute creates a liberty interest. Instead of requiring particularized standards that actually constrain the discretion of the relevant decisionmakers, the Court is satisfied simply by the presence of a purported "standard." Because I find the Court's approach at odds with our liberty interest jurisprudence, I dissent.
