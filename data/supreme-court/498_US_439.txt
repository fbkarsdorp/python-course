OPINION
JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether suits for violations
of the Commerce Clause may be brought under 93 Stat. 1284, as amended, 42 U. S.
C. § 1983. We hold that they may.
I
Petitioner does business as an unincorporated motor carrier with his principal
place of business in Ohio. He owns tractors and trailers that are registered in
Ohio and operated in several States including Nebraska. On December 17, 1984, he
filed a class action in a Nebraska trial court challenging the constitutionality
of certain "retaliatory" taxes and fees imposed by the State of Nebraska on
motor carriers with vehicles registered in other States and operated in
Nebraska. 1 In his complaint, petitioner claimed, inter alia, that the taxes and
fees constituted an unlawful burden on interstate commerce and that respondents
were liable under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. Petitioner sought declaratory and
injunctive relief, refunds of all retaliatory taxes and fees paid,  and
attorney's fees and costs.
After a bench trial based on stipulated facts, the court concluded that the
taxes and fees at issue violated the Commerce Clause "because they are imposed
only on motor carriers whose vehicles are registered outside the State of
Nebraska, while no comparable tax or fee is imposed on carriers whose vehicles
are registered in the State of Nebraska." App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a. It
therefore permanently enjoined respondents from "assessing, levying, or
collecting" the taxes and fees. Id., at 30a. The court also held that petitioner
was entitled to attorney's fees and expenses under the equitable "common fund"
doctrine. The court, however, entered judgment for respondents on the  
remaining claims, including the § 1983 claim. Petitioner appealed the
dismissal of his § 1983 claim, and respondents cross-appealed the trial
court's allowance of attorney's fees and expenses under the common fund
doctrine. Respondents did not, however, appeal the trial court's determination
that the retaliatory taxes and fees violated the Commerce Clause.
The Supreme Court of Nebraska affirmed the dismissal of petitioner's § 1983
claim, but reversed the trial court's allowance of fees and expenses under the
common fund doctrine. See Dennis v. State, 234 Neb. 427, 451 N.W.2d 676 (1990).
With respect to the § 1983 claim, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that "despite
the broad language of § 1983 . . . there is no cause of action under § 1983 for
violations of the commerce clause." Id., at 430, 451 N.W.2d at 678. The court
relied largely on the reasoning in Consolidated Freightways Corp. of Delaware v.
Kassel, 730 F.2d 1139 (CA8), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 834, 83 L. Ed. 2d 68, 105 S.
Ct. 126 (1984), which held that claims under the Commerce Clause are not
cognizable under § 1983 because, among other things, "the Commerce Clause does
not establish individual rights against government, but instead allocates power
between the state and federal governments." 730 F.2d at 1144.
As the Supreme Court of Nebraska recognized, see 234 Neb. at 430, 451 N.W.2d at
678, there is a division of authority on the question whether claims for
violations of the Commerce Clause may be brought under § 1983. 2 We granted
certiorari to resolve this issue, 495 U.S. 956 (1990), and we now reverse.
II
A broad construction of § 1983 3 is compelled by the statutory
language, which speaks of deprivations of "any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws." (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we have
"repeatedly held that the   coverage of  must be broadly
construed." Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 105, 107 L.
Ed. 2d 420, 110 S. Ct. 444 (1989).The legislative history of the section also
stresses that as a remedial statute, it should be "'liberally and beneficently
construed.'" Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658,
684, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611, 98 S. Ct. 2018 (1978) (quoting Rep.
Shellabarger, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 68 (1871)). 4
As respondents argue, the "prime focus" of § 1983
and related provisions was to ensure "a right of action to enforce the
protections of the Fourteenth Amendment and the federal laws enacted
pursuant thereto," Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441 U.S. 600,
611, 60 L. Ed. 2d 508, 99 S. Ct. 1905 (1979), but the Court has never restricted
the section's scope to the effectuation of that goal. Rather, we have given full
effect to its broad language, recognizing that   § 1983 "provide a
remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of
federally protected rights." Monell, supra, at 700-701. Thus, for example, we
have refused to limit the phrase "and laws" in § 1983 to civil rights or equal
protection laws. See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4, 6-8, 65 L. Ed.
2d 555, 100 S. Ct. 2502 (1980).
Even more relevant to this case, we have rejected attempts to limit the types of
constitutional rights that are encompassed within the phrase "rights,
privileges, or immunities." For example, in Lynch v. Household Finance Corp.,
405 U.S. 538, 31 L. Ed. 2d 424, 92 S. Ct. 1113 (1972), we refused to limit the
phrase to "personal" rights, as opposed to "property" rights. 5 We first  
noted that neither the words nor the legislative history of the statute
distinguished between personal and property rights. Id., at 543. We also
rejected that distinction because of the "virtual impossibility" of applying it,
particularly in "mixed" cases involving both types of rights.  Id., at 550-551.
We further concluded that   "the dichotomy between personal liberties and
property rights is a false one. . . . The right to enjoy property without
unlawful deprivation, no less than the right to speak or the right to travel, is
in truth a 'personal' right, whether the 'property' in question be a welfare
check, a home, or a savings account." Id., at 552. See also United States v.
Price, 383 U.S. 787, 800-806, 16 L. Ed. 2d 267, 86 S. Ct. 1152 (1966).
Petitioner contends that the Commerce Clause confers "rights,
privileges, or immunities" within the meaning of § 1983. We agree.   The
Commerce Clause provides that "Congress shall have Power . . . to regulate
Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian
Tribes." U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Although the language of that Clause
speaks only of Congress' power over commerce, "the Court long has recognized
that it also limits the power of the States to erect barriers against interstate
trade." Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U.S. 27, 35, 64 L. Ed. 2d
702, 100 S. Ct. 2009 (1980). 6
Respondents argue, as the court below held, that the Commerce Clause merely
allocates power between the Federal and State Governments and does not confer
"rights." Brief for Respondents 14-17. There is no doubt that   the
Commerce Clause is a power-allocating provision, giving Congress pre-emptive
authority over the regulation of interstate commerce. It is also clear, however,
that the Commerce Clause does more than confer power on the Federal Government;
it is also a substantive "restriction on permissible state regulation" of
interstate commerce. Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322, 326, 60 L. Ed. 2d 250, 99
S. Ct. 1727 (1979). The Commerce Clause "has long been recognized as a
self-executing limitation on the power of the States to enact laws imposing
substantial burdens on such commerce." South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v.
Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82, 87, 81 L. Ed. 2d 71, 104 S. Ct. 2237 (1984). In addition,
individuals injured by state action that violates this aspect of the Commerce
Clause may sue and obtain injunctive and declaratory relief. See, e. g.,
McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Dept.
of Business Regulation of Fla., 496 U.S. 18, 31, 110 L. Ed. 2d 17, 110 S. Ct.
2238 (1990). Indeed, the trial court in the case before us awarded petitioner
such relief, and respondents do not contest that decision. We have also recently
held that taxpayers who are required to pay taxes before challenging a state tax
that is subsequently determined to violate the Commerce Clause are entitled to
retrospective relief "that will cure any unconstitutional discrimination against
interstate commerce during the contested tax period." Id., at 51.   This
combined restriction on state power and entitlement to relief under the Commerce
Clause amounts to a "right, privilege, or immunity" under the ordinary meaning
of those terms. 7
The Court has often described the Commerce Clause as conferring a
"right" to engage in interstate trade free from restrictive state regulation. In
Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47, 35 L. Ed. 649, 11 S. Ct. 851  
(1891), in which the Court struck down a license requirement imposed on certain
out-of-state companies, the Court stated: "To carry on interstate commerce is
not a franchise or a privilege granted by the State; it is a right which every
citizen of the United States is entitled to exercise under the Constitution and
laws of the United States." Id., at 57. Similarly, Western Union Telegraph Co.
v. Kansas ex rel. Coleman, 216 U.S. 1, 26, 54 L. Ed. 355, 30 S. Ct. 190 (1910),
referred to "the substantial rights of those engaged in interstate commerce."
And Garrity v. New Jersey, 385 U.S. 493, 500, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562, 87 S. Ct. 616
(1967), declared that engaging in interstate commerce is a "righ of
constitutional stature." More recently, Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax
Comm'n, 429 U.S. 318, 50 L. Ed. 2d 514, 97 S. Ct. 599 (1977), held that regional
stock exchanges had standing to challenge a tax on securities transactions as
violating the Commerce Clause because, among other things, the exchanges were
"asserting their right under the Commerce Clause to engage in interstate
commerce free of discriminatory taxes on their business and they allege that the
transfer tax indirectly infringes on that right." Id., at 320, n.3.
Last Term, in Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493
U.S. 103, 107 L. Ed. 2d 420, 110 S. Ct. 444 (1989), we set forth   three
considerations for determining whether a federal statute confers a "right"
within the meaning of § 1983:
"In deciding whether a federal right has been violated, we have
considered  whether the provision in question creates
obligations binding on the governmental unit or rather 'does no more
than express a congressional preference for certain kinds of
treatment.' Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S.
1, 19, 67 L. Ed. 2d 694, 101 S. Ct. 1531 (1981).  The interest the
plaintiff asserts must not be 'too vague and amorphous'  to be 'beyond
the competence of the judiciary to enforce.' Wright v. Roanoke
Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U.S. 418, 431-432, 93 L. Ed.
2d 781, 107 S. Ct. 766 (1987).  We have also asked whether the
provision in question was 'intended to benefit' the putative
plaintiff.  Id., at 430; see also id., at 433 (O'CONNOR, J.,
dissenting) (citing Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 78, 45 L. Ed.
2d 26, 95 S. Ct. 2080 (1975)." 493 U.S. 103 at 106, 110 S. Ct. 444,
107 L. Ed. 2d 420.
See also Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U.S. 498, 509, 110 L. Ed. 2d
455, 110 S. Ct. 2510 (1990). Respondents do not dispute that the first two
considerations weigh in favor of recognition of a right here, but seize upon the
third consideration -- intent to benefit the plaintiff -- arguing that the
Commerce Clause does not confer rights within the meaning of § 1983 because it
was not designed to benefit individuals, but rather was designed to promote
national economic and political union. Brief for Respondents 19-24.
This argument, however, was implicitly rejected in Boston Stock Exchange, supra,
at 321, n.3, where we found that the plaintiffs were arguably within the "zone
of interests" protected by the Commerce Clause. Moreover, the Court's repeated
references to "rights" under the Commerce Clause constitute a
recognition that   the Clause was intended to benefit those who, like
petitioner, are engaged in interstate commerce. The "constitutional protection
against burdens on commerce is for  benefit . . . ." Morgan v. Virginia,
328 U.S. 373, 376-377, 90 L. Ed. 1317, 66 S. Ct. 1050 (1946). As Justice
Jackson, writing for the Court, eloquently explained:
"Our system, fostered by the Commerce Clause, is that every farmer and
every craftsman shall be encouraged to produce by the certainty that
he will have free access to every market in the Nation, that
no home embargoes will withhold his exports, and no foreign state will
by customs duties or regulations exclude them. Likewise, every
consumer may look to the free competition from every producing area in
the Nation to protect him from exploitation by any. Such was the
vision of the Founders; such has been the doctrine of this Court which
has given it reality." H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S.
525, 539, 93 L. Ed. 865, 69 S. Ct. 657 (1949).
Respondents attempt to analogize the
Commerce Clause to the Supremacy Clause, Brief for Respondents 17-18, which we
have held does not by itself confer any "rights, privileges, or immunities"
within the meaning of § 1983. See Golden State, supra, at 106; Chapman, 441 U.S.
at 613. The Supremacy Clause, however, is "not a source of any federal rights";
rather, it "'secure' federal rights by according them priority whenever they
come in conflict with state law." Ibid. By contrast,   the Commerce Clause
of its own force imposes limitations on state regulation of commerce and is the
source of a right of action in those injured by regulations that exceed such
limitations. 8
Respondents also argue that the protection from interference
with trade conferred by the Commerce Clause cannot be a "right" because it is
subject to qualification or elimination by Congress. Brief for Respondents 21.
That argument proves too much, however, because federal statutory rights may
also be altered or eliminated by Congress. Until Congress does so, such rights
operate as "a guarantee of freedom for private conduct that the State may not
abridge." Golden State, supra, at 112. The same is true of the Commerce
Clause. 9
III
We conclude that the Supreme Court of Nebraska erred in
holding that petitioner's   Commerce Clause claim could not be brought
under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is
therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not
inconsistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
DISSENT BY: KENNEDY

JUSTICE KENNEDY, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.
In Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U.S. 103, 114, 107 L. Ed. 2d
420, 110 S. Ct. 444 (1989), I dissented from the Court's determination that 42
U. S. C. § 1983 creates a cause of action for damages when the only wrong
committed by the State or local entity is its misapprehension of the boundary
between state and federal power. Today's decision compounds the error of Golden
State. The majority drifts far from the purposes and history of § 1983 and again
holds § 1983 applicable to a State's quite innocent but mistaken judgment
respecting the shifting boundary between two sovereign powers. The majority
removes one of the statute's few remaining limits and increases the burden that
a state or local government will face in defending its economic
regulation and taxation. With respect, I dissent.
I
The majority must acknowledge, under even Golden State, that not all violations
of federal law give rise to a § 1983 action. The plaintiff must assert "rights,
privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws." 42 U. S. C. §
1983. The majority appears to base its decision upon three grounds. First, the
"ordinary meaning" of the term "right" as confirmed by Black's Law Dictionary
indicates that the Commerce Clause provides petitioner a right. Ante, at 447,
and n.7. Second, our cases contain scattered references to a "right" to engage
in interstate commerce. Ante, at 448. And third, the Commerce Clause purportedly
meets Golden State's test to determine whether a statutory violation gives rise
to a § 1983 cause of action, because the Commerce Clause was intended to benefit
those who engage in interstate commerce. Ante, at 448-450. The majority errs, I
must submit, when it ignores what the sponsors of § 1983 told us about the scope
of the phrase "rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution,"
and errs further when it applies the Golden State test in this context. Even
were I to apply the majority's various tests, moreover, I would reach the
opposite conclusion.
A
The Golden State test, arguably necessary in assessing whether any of the
hundreds of statutory provisions that confer express obligations upon the States
secure rights within the meaning of § 1983, is not appropriate in
this case, where the question is whether a right is secured by a provision of
the Constitution. Constitutional provisions are not so numerous, nor enacted
with such frequency, that we are compelled to apply an ahistorical test. There
is a ready alternative. We can distinguish between those constitutional
provisions which secure the rights of persons vis-a-vis the States, and those
provisions which allocate power between the Federal and State
Governments. The former secure rights within the meaning of § 1983, but the
latter do not.
The Commerce Clause, found at Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, of the Constitution, is a
grant of power to Congress. It states simply that "the Congress shall have Power
. . . To regulate commerce . . . among the several States." By its own
terms as well as its design, as interpreted by this Court, the Commerce Clause
is a structural provision allocating authority between federal and state
sovereignties. It does not purport to secure rights. The history leading to the
drafting and ratification of the Constitution confirms these premises.
The lack of a national power over commerce during the Articles of Confederation
led to ongoing disputes among the States, and the prospect of a descent toward
even more intense commercial animosity was one of the principal arguments in
favor of the Constitution. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 7, pp. 62-63 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton); id., No. 11, pp. 89-90 (A. Hamilton); id., No.
22, pp. 143-145 (A. Hamilton); id., No. 42, pp. 267-269 (J. Madison); id., No.
53, p. 333 (J. Madison).
"The sole purpose for which Virginia initiated the movement which
ultimately produced the Constitution was 'to take into consideration
the trade of the United States; to examine the relative situations and
trade of the said States; to consider how far a uniform system in
their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest
and their permanent harmony.'" H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336
U.S. 525, 533, 93 L. Ed. 865, 69 S. Ct. 657 (1949) (citation omitted).
The Framers intended the Commerce Clause as a way to preserve economic union and
to suppress interstate rivalry. The Clause assigned prerogatives to the general
government, not personal rights to those who engaged in commerce. See, e. g.,
id., at 533-535; Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 523, 79 L. Ed.
1032, 55 S. Ct. 497 (1935); Collins, Economic Union as a Constitutional Value,
63 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 43, 51-56 (1988). "The necessity of centralized
regulation of commerce among the states was so obvious and so fully recognized
that the few words of the Commerce Clause were little illuminated by debate." H.
P. Hood & Sons, Inc., supra, at 534. An exhaustive examination of the debates
reports only nine references to interstate commerce in the records of the
Convention, all directed at the dangers of interstate rivalry and retaliation.
See Abel, The Commerce Clause in the Constitutional Convention and in
Contemporary Comment, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 432, 470-471, and nn. 169-175 (1941). It
is not for serious dispute that the Framers of the Commerce Clause had economic
union as their goal, nor that their deliberations are devoid of any evidence of
intent to secure personal rights under this Clause.
Section 1983 has its origins in § 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat.
27, and § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13. See Lynch v. Household
Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 543, n.7, 31 L. Ed. 2d 424, 92 S. Ct. 1113 (1972).
Until recent cases, we have placed great reliance upon the sponsors of the 1871
Act in interpreting the scope of § 1983. See, e. g., Monell v. New York City
Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690, 56 L. Ed. 2d 611, 98 S. Ct. 2018
(1978) ("Analysis of the legislative history of the Civil Rights Act of 1871
compels the conclusion that Congress did intend municipalities . . . to be
included among those persons to whom § 1983 applies" (emphasis in original));
Lynch, supra, at 545-546 (sponsors intended § 1983 to protect property rights as
well as personal rights); Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 172-185, 5 L. Ed. 2d
492, 81 S. Ct. 473 (1961) (legislative history of § 1983 supports the conclusion
that § 1983 plaintiff need not exhaust state remedies).
Those same sponsors of § 1983 understood and announced a distinction between
power-allocating and rights-securing provisions of the Constitution. In
discussing the meaning of the phrase "rights, privileges or immunities" in the
original House version of § 2 of the 1871 Act, Representative Shellabarger,
Chairman of the House Select Committee which drafted the Act, and floor manager
for the bill, explained:
"Most of the provisions of the Constitution which
restrain and directly relate to the States, such as those in tenth
section of first article, that 'no State shall make a treaty,' 'grant
letters of marque,' 'coin money,' 'emit bills of credit,' &c., relate
to the divisions of the political powers of the State and General
Governments. They do not relate directly to the rights of persons
within the States and as between the States and such persons therein.
These prohibitions upon the political powers of the States are all of
such nature that they can be, and even have been, when the occasion
arose, enforced by the courts of the United States declaring void all
State acts of encroachment on Federal powers. Thus, and thus
sufficiently, has the United States 'enforced' these provisions of the
Constitution. But there are some that are not of this class. These are
where the court secures the rights or the liabilities of persons
within the States, as between such persons and the States.
"These three are: first, that as to fugitives from Justice; second,
that as to fugitives from service, (or slaves;) third, that declaring
that the 'citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the
privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.'" Cong.
Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 69-70 (1871) (hereinafter Cong.
Globe) (referring to Art. IV, § 2, of the Constitution as securing
rights of persons).
This passage confirms Representative Shellabarger's view that all but three
provisions of the Constitution as first enacted allocate power rather than
secure the rights of persons "as between such persons and the States," and that
the power-allocating provisions had not been "enforced"  by legislation, but
instead could be asserted as grounds for invalidating state action.
Ibid. 1 To those original provisions which secure rights of persons
with respect to States, and within the meaning of § 1983, the sponsors of § 1983
added the constitutional guarantees contained in the Civil War Amendments,
including the provisions of the Bill of Rights incorporated into the Fourteenth
Amendment. Every specific mention of rights secured by the 1871 Act refers to
these constitutional provisions. See, e. g., Cong. Globe 475-476 (Rep. Dawes;
privileges and immunities, Bill of Rights); id., at App. 84-85 (Rep. Bingham;
equal protection, first eight Amendments); id., at App. 153 (Rep. Garfield;
right to vote, privileges and immunities, equal protection).
Statements of other supporters of the 1871 Act provide further evidence that
Congress did not consider the Commerce Clause to secure the rights of persons
within the meaning of § 1983. Representative Hoar distinguished between two
objectives of the Constitution: to "provide . . . for the protection and
regulation of commercial intercourse, domestic and foreign"; and to "promote the
general welfare by prohibiting the States from doing what is inconsistent with
civil liberty, and compelling them to do what is essential to its maintenance."
Cong. Globe 333. The 1871 Act was designed to enforce only those provisions of
the Constitution providing for "the protection of personal liberty and civil
rights," not "the protection of commerce." Ibid. Representative  
Trumbull made the same distinction between these categories of
constitutional provisions. Id., at 575. The sponsors of § 1983 thus gave us a
straightforward answer to the question of which constitutional violations give
rise to a § 1983 action, and told us that violations of power-allocating
provisions such as the Commerce Clause do not.
Not only did the 42d Congress understand the difference between rights-securing
and power-allocating provisions of the Constitution, but this Court's decisions
of more than 100 years support the distinction. All previous cases in which this
Court has determined (or assumed) that a constitutional violation gives rise to
a § 1983 cause of action alleged violations of rights-securing provisions of the
Constitution, not power-allocating provisions. See, e. g., Monroe v. Pape, 365
U.S. at 171 ("Allegation of facts constituting a deprivation under color of
state authority of a right guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment satisfies to
that extent the requirement of R. S. § 1979 "); Lane v.
Wilson, 307 U.S. 268, 83 L. Ed. 1281, 59 S. Ct. 872 (1939) (Fifteenth Amendment
violation supports § 1983 cause of action).
In our only previous case discussing a § 1983 claim brought for the violation of
a supposed right secured by Article I of the Constitution, we held that
violation of the Contracts Clause does not give rise to a § 1983 cause of
action. Carter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 317, 29 L. Ed. 202, 5 S. Ct. 928 (1885). As
is true of the Commerce Clause, the Court held that the Contracts Clause can be
said to secure individual rights "only indirectly and incidentally." Id., at 322
. The Court further explained that the only right secured by the Contracts
Clause is the "right to have a judicial determination, declaring the nullity of
the attempt to impair  obligation." Ibid.
The Contracts Clause of Art. I, § 10, provides that "no State shall . . . pass
any . . . Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts." At least such language
would provide some support for an argument that the Contracts Clause prohibits
States from "doing what is inconsistent with civil liberty." Cong.
Globe 333 (Rep. Hoar). If the Contracts Clause, an express limitation upon
States' ability to impair the contractual rights of citizens, does not secure
rights within the meaning of § 1983, it assuredly demands a great leap for the
majority to conclude that the Commerce Clause secures the rights of persons. The
Commerce Clause is, if anything, a less obvious source of rights for purposes of
§ 1983, as its text only implies a limitation upon state power.
At best, all that can be said is that the Commerce Clause grants Congress the
power to regulate interstate commerce; from this grant of power, the Court has
implied a limitation upon the power of a State to regulate interstate commerce;
and in turn, courts provide a person injured by taxation that exceeds the limits
of the Commerce Clause the "right to have a judicial determination, declaring
the nullity of the attempt to" levy a discriminatory tax.  Carter, supra, at 322
. I find it ironic that Carter draws a distinction of nearly the same character
as Golden State, between provisions which directly secure rights and those which
do so "only as an incident" of their purpose.  Golden State, 493 U.S. at 109.
Yet, the majority finds that the Commerce Clause was "intended to benefit the
putative plaintiff," Golden State, supra, at 108, while Carter held that the
Contracts Clause only provides incidental benefits.
In Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 31 L. Ed. 2d 424, 92 S. Ct.
1113 (1972), we rejected an attempt to limit § 1983 to personal rights as
opposed to property rights, in that case a deprivation of property in violation
of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The legislative history
of § 1983 did not support such a distinction, and we recognized both its false
nature and the impossibility of its application. Today, on the other hand, the
Court rejects a distinction which finds strong support in the
legislative history of § 1983 and would bring no difficulties of application. I
see no good reason for this rejection and suggest that the Court's decision only
can do mischief.
B
The majority rejects the weight of historical evidence in favor of scattered
statements in our cases that refer to a "right" to engage in interstate
commerce. Ante, at 448. None of these cases, however, hold that the Commerce
Clause secures a personal right. Instead, they interpret the Commerce Clause as
allocating power among sovereigns. See Crutcher v. Kentucky, 141 U.S. 47, 57, 35
L. Ed. 649, 11 S. Ct. 851 (1891) (regulation of interstate commerce "not within
the province of state legislation, but within that of national legislation");
Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Kansas ex rel. Coleman, 216 U.S. 1, 21, 54 L. Ed.
355, 30 S. Ct. 190 (1910) (same). If the majority chooses to rely upon such
statements, far removed from the issue at hand, I would remind it that this
Court, in a much closer context, has established that a case in which the
plaintiff relies upon the dormant Commerce Clause "may be one arising under the
Constitution, within the meaning of that term, as used in other statutes, but it
is not one brought on account of the deprivation of a right, privilege or
immunity secured by the Constitution." Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co.,
115 U.S. 611, 615-616, 29 L. Ed. 502, 6 S. Ct. 192 (1885). 2 The statements upon
which the majority relies are weak support for its conclusion.
In similar fashion, McKesson Corp. v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and
Tobacco, Dept. of Business Regulation of Fla., 496 U.S. 18, 110 L. Ed. 2d 17,
110 S. Ct. 2238 (1990), in which the majority finds recent support for
its view of the Commerce Clause, merely applies our traditional due process
analysis for deprivation of property to the context of exaction of an unlawful
tax. McKesson Corp. holds that if a State insists that taxpayers pay first and
obtain review of a tax's validity in a later refund action, then due process
requires meaningful postpayment relief for taxes paid pursuant to an
unconstitutional scheme.  Id., at 31. In discussing the nature of the
constitutional violation, McKesson Corp. acknowledges that States are accorded
great flexibility in structuring the remedy for a discriminatory tax that
violates the Commerce Clause. Rather than refunding the tax, "to the extent
consistent with other constitutional restrictions, the State may assess and
collect back taxes from petitioner's competitors who benefited from the
rate reductions during the contested tax period." Id., at 40.
If the State refused to provide any remedy, then the taxpayer would arguably
have a § 1983 claim, but that claim would be for a deprivation of property
without due process of law, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, not of the
Commerce Clause. McKesson Corp. in no way supports the existence of a
§ 1983 cause of action for Commerce Clause violations.
Finally, following Golden State, the majority asks whether the provision in
question was intended to benefit the putative plaintiff. Ante, at 449. The
majority fails to locate in the text or history of the Commerce Clause any such
intent, but nevertheless concludes that any argument to the contrary was
"implicitly rejected in Boston Stock Exchange   State Tax Comm'n,
429 U.S.,] at 321, n.3, where we found that the plaintiffs were arguably within
the 'zone of interests' protected by the Commerce Clause." Ante, at 449. I fail
to see how a determination that a particular plaintiff is within the "zone of
interests" protected by a provision requires a finding that the provision was
intended to benefit that plaintiff, or secures a right for purposes of § 1983.
To the contrary, our zone of interest cases have rejected any requirement that
there be a "congressional purpose to benefit the would-be plaintiff."
Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 399-400, 93 L. Ed. 2d 757,
107 S. Ct. 750 (1987). The plaintiff need only demonstrate a "plausible
relationship" between his interest and the policies to be advanced by the
relevant provision.  Id., at 403. 3
The majority's treatment of the question confuses the concept of standing with
that of a cause of action. We have considered these as distinct categories and
should continue to do so. See Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 239-240, n.18, 60
L. Ed. 2d 846, 99 S. Ct. 2264 (1979). A taxpayer such as petitioner may be
arguably within the zone of interests protected by the Commerce Clause. This is
not, however, sufficient to demonstrate that the Commerce Clause secures a right
of petitioner within the meaning of § 1983. Thus, in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S.
919, 935-936, 77 L. Ed. 2d 317, 103 S. Ct. 2764 (1983), we held that an
individual had standing to raise a separation of powers challenge alleging a
violation of the Presentment Clauses, Art. I, § 7, cls. 2 and 3. In a
very fundamental sense, separation of powers is designed to secure
individual liberty. Yet, we would not say that the Presentment Clauses secure
personal rights. Rather, Chadha was able to assert the interests of the other
branches of Government because he met our traditional test of standing.
I cannot doubt the truth of the statement, ante, at 449-450 (quoting H. P. Hood
& Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. at 539), that the Commerce Clause benefits
individuals and entities engaged in interstate commerce. Nor do I question the
importance of our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence in guaranteeing a
single, national market. Benefits to those engaged in commerce, however, are
incidental to the purpose of the Commerce Clause; they are but evidence of its
sound application. That the Commerce Clause benefits individual traders or
consumers does not satisfy the majority's test that a provision must have been
intended for the benefit of a particular plaintiff; nor do such benefits prove
that the provision secures a plaintiff's constitutional right to engage in any
one activity, to receive any direct benefit, or to avoid any specific detriment.
Rather, the Commerce Clause "benefits particular parties only as an incident
of" its allocation of power between federal and state sovereignties.
Golden State, 493 U.S. at 109.
I continue to draw the distinction made in my Golden State dissent, id., at 113,
and would hold that while the dormant Commerce Clause does not secure a right,
it gives rise to a legal interest in petitioner against taxation which violates
the dormant Commerce Clause. Thus, petitioner can rely upon the
unconstitutionality of the tax in defending a collection action brought by the
State, or in pursuing state remedies. This ability to invoke the Commerce Clause
against a State, however, is not equivalent to finding a secured right under §
1983. If that were so, all violations of federal law would give rise to a § 1983
cause of action, and there would be little reason to search for statements
supporting the existence of a right to engage in interstate commerce or to apply
the Golden State test. The majority does not purport to rest its
decision upon such an all-inclusive view of § 1983, but that is the necessary
consequence of its reasoning.
The Court's analysis demonstrates the poverty of the "intended to benefit" test
in the constitutional context, for it shows that even structural provisions that
benefit individuals incidentally come within its purview. The Court's logic
extends far beyond the Commerce Clause, and creates a whole new class of § 1983
suits derived from Article I. For example, the Court's rationale creates a §
1983 cause of action when a State violates the constitutional doctrine of
intergovernmental tax immunity, Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S.
803, 813, 103 L. Ed. 2d 891, 109 S. Ct. 1500 (1989) (violation of statute
"coextensive with the prohibition against discriminatory taxes embodied in the
modern constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity"), interferes
with the federal power over foreign relations, see Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S.
429, 19 L. Ed. 2d 683, 88 S. Ct. 664 (1968), applies a duty upon
imports in violation of Art. I, § 10, cl. 2, see Hooven & Allison Co. v. Evatt,
324 U.S. 652, 89 L. Ed. 1252, 65 S. Ct. 870 (1945), invades the federal power
over regulation of the entrance and residence of aliens in violation of Art. I,
§ 8, cl. 4, see Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 66-67, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61 S.
Ct. 399 (1941), or attempts to tax income upon a federal obligation in
derogation of Congress' Art. I, § 8, cl. 2, power to "borrow Money on the credit
of the United States," see Missouri ex rel. Missouri Ins. Co. v. Gehner, 281
U.S. 313, 74 L. Ed. 870, 50 S. Ct. 326 (1930). There is no textual or other
support for holding that § 1983 imposes such far-reaching liabilities upon the
States.
II
Petitioner here does not complain that the State of Nebraska has failed to
provide him an adequate forum in which to contest the validity of Nebraska's
tax. Nebraska has done so. The Nebraska courts acknowledged the invalidity of
the State's tax, enjoined its collection, and directed petitioner to file a
refund claim for the taxes he had paid to the State. Rather, the
significance of the Court's decision, in this and future Commerce Clause
litigation, is that a § 1983 claim may permit dormant Commerce Clause plaintiffs
to recover attorney's fees and expenses under 42 U. S. C. § 1988.
In the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-559, 90 Stat.
2641, codified at 42 U. S. C. § 1988, Congress authorized the award of
attorney's fees to prevailing parties in, inter alia, § 1983 litigation. The
award of attorney's fees encourages vindication of federal rights which,
Congress recognized, might otherwise go unenforced because of the plaintiffs'
lack of resources and the small size of any expected monetary recovery. See S.
Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 6 (1976). Congress was reassured that § 1988 would be
"limited to cases arising under our civil rights laws, a category of cases in
which attorneys fees have been traditionally regarded as appropriate."
Id., at 4.
The significant economic interests at stake in dormant Commerce Clause cases, as
well as the resources available to the typical dormant Commerce Clause
plaintiff, make such concerns far removed from the realities of dormant Commerce
Clause litigation. The pages of the United States Reports testify to the ability
of major corporations and industry associations to commence and maintain dormant
Commerce Clause litigation without receiving attorney's fee awards under § 1988.
By making such fee awards available, the Court does not vindicate the purposes
of § 1983 or § 1988, but merely shifts the balance of power away from the States
and toward interstate businesses.
Today's decision raises far more questions about the proper conduct of
challenges to the validity of state taxation than it answers. The Tax Injunction
Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1341, prevents any attempt in federal court to "enjoin,
suspend or restrain" assessment or collection of a state tax, so long as "a
plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State." The
principle of comity likewise prevents a federal court from entertaining any
action for damages under § 1983 to redress allegedly unconstitutional
state taxation. Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc. v. McNary,
454 U.S. 100, 70 L. Ed. 2d 271, 102 S. Ct. 177 (1981). Relying upon the
"overriding interests of the state in an efficient, expeditious and
nondisruptive resolution of . . . tax disputes," Backus v. Chilivis, 236 Ga.
500, 505, 224 S.E.2d 370, 374 (1976), state courts have refused to permit
plaintiffs to proceed under § 1983 where there exists a complete remedy under
state law. Ibid.; Spencer v. South Carolina Tax Comm'n, 281 S.C. 492, 497, 316
S.E.2d 386, 388-389 (1984), aff'd by an equally divided Court, 471 U.S. 82, 105
S. Ct. 1859, 85 L. Ed. 2d 62 (1985) (per curiam). These questions now become of
paramount importance, as we risk destruction of state fiscal integrity in a
manner which may require congressional correction.
Today's opinion gives no hint of § 1983's character as an extraordinary remedy
passed during Reconstruction to protect basic civil rights against oppressive
state action. Section 1983 now becomes simply one more weapon in the litigant's
arsenal, to be considered whenever the defendant is a state actor and its use is
advantageous to the plaintiff. I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the
Court.
