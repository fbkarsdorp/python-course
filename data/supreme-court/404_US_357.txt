OPINION
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
John Schilb, of Belleville, Illinois, was arrested on January 16, 1969, and charged (a) with leaving the scene of an automobile accident and (b) with obstructing traffic.  In order to gain his liberty pending trial, and in accord with the Illinois bail statutes hereinafter described, Schilb deposited $ 75 in cash with the clerk of the court.  This amount was 10% of the aggregate bail fixed on the two charges ($ 500 on the first and $ 250 on the second).  At his ensuing trial Schilb was acquitted of the charge of leaving the scene,  but was convicted of traffic obstruction.  When he paid his fine, the amount Schilb had deposited was returned to him decreased, however, by $ 7.50 retained as "bail bond costs" by the court clerk pursuant to the statute.  The amount so retained was 1% of the specified bail and 10% of the amount actually deposited.
Schilb, by this purported state class action against the court clerk, the county, and the county treasurer, attacks the statutory 1% charge on Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection grounds. 1 The Circuit Court of St. Clair County upheld the statute and dismissed the complaint.  The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed, with two justices dissenting.   46 Ill. 2d 538, 264 N. E. 2d 377 (1970). We noted probable jurisdiction.   402 U.S. 928 (1971).
I
The Illinois bail statutes compose Article 110 of the State's Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, made effective January 1, 1964.  This Code complemented Illinois' then new and revised Criminal Code of 1961, made effective January 1, 1962.  The work of revision of the theretofore existing statutes was that of a Joint Committee of the Illinois State and Chicago Bar Associations.  See 1 Ill. Rev. Stat. 1963, p. 1629.
Prior to 1964 the professional bail bondsman system with all its abuses 2 was in full and odorous bloom in Illinois.  Under that system the bail bondsman   customarily collected the maximum fee (10% of the amount of the bond) permitted by statute, House Bill No. 734, approved July 17, 1959, Ill. Laws 1959, pp. 1372, 1376, and retained that entire amount even though the accused fully satisfied the conditions of the bond.  See  People ex rel. Gendron v. Ingram, 34 Ill. 2d 623, 626, 217 N. E. 2d 803, 805 (1966). Payment of this substantial "premium" was required of the good risk as well as of the bad.  The results were that a heavy and irretrievable burden fell upon the accused, to the excellent profit of the bondsman, and that professional bondsmen, and not the courts, exercised significant control over the actual workings of the bail system.
One of the stated purposes of the new bail provisions in the 1963 Code was to rectify this offensive situation.  The purpose appears to have been accomplished.  It is said that the bail bondsman abruptly disappeared in Illinois "due primarily to the success of the ten percent bail deposit provision." Boyle, Bail Under the Judicial Article,  17 De Paul L. Rev. 267, 272 (1968). See Kamin, Bail Administration in Illinois,  53 Ill. B. J. 674, 680 (1965).
II
Article 110 of the 1963 Code, as it read at the time Schilb was arrested and charged, provided that an eligible accused could obtain pretrial release in one of three ways:
(1) Under § 110-2 he may be released on his personal  recognizance. 3
(2) Under § 110-7 he may execute a bail bond and deposit with the clerk cash equal to only 10% of the bail or $ 25, whichever is the greater. 4 When bail is made in this way and the conditions of the bond have been performed, the clerk returns to the accused 90% of the sum deposited. The remaining 10% (1% of the bail) is retained by the clerk "as bail bond costs."
(3) Under § 110-8 he may execute a bail bond and secure it by a deposit with the clerk of the full amount of the bail in cash, or in stocks and bonds authorized for trust funds in Illinois, or by unencumbered nonexempt Illinois real estate worth double the amount of the bail. 5 When bail is made in this way and the conditions of the bond have been performed, the clerk returns the deposit of cash or stocks or bonds, or releases the real estate, as the case may be, without charge or retention of any amount.
In each case bail is fixed by a judicial officer.  Section 110-5 prescribes factors to be considered in fixing the amount of bail. 6 Under § 110-6 either the State or the defendant may apply to the court for an increase or for a reduction in the amount of bail or for alteration of the bond's conditions. 7
The choice between § 110-7 and § 110-8 is reserved to the accused.
The thinking and intentions of the Joint Committee revisers are apparent from the Committee's comments, as revised by its Chairman, Professor Charles H. Bowman, and reproduced in Ill.  Ann. Stat., c. 38 (Smith-Hurd ed. 1970). 8
The parties have stipulated that when bail in a particular case is fixed, the judge's "discretion in such respect is not guided by statute, rule of court or any definite, fixed standard; various and divers judges in fact fix the amount of bail for the same types of offenses at various and divers amounts, without relationship as to guilt or innocence of the particular defendant in a criminal charge, and without relationship of the particular offense charged and the bail fixed." They have also stipulated, "The actual cost of administering the provisions of said Sections 110-7 and 110-8 are substantially the same but there may probably be a slightly greater cost in the administration of Section 110-8."
III
The Court more than once has said that state legislative reform by way of classification is not to be invalidated merely because the legislature moves one step at a time.  "The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination."  Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 489 (1955).  "Legislatures are presumed to have acted constitutionally . . . and their statutory classifications  will be set aside only if no grounds can be conceived to justify them. . . .  With this much discretion, a legislature traditionally has been allowed to take reform 'one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.'"  McDonald v. Board of Election Commissioners, 394 U.S. 802, 809 (1969). The measure of equal protection has been described variously as whether "the distinctions drawn have some basis in practical experience,"  South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 331 (1966), or whether the legislature's action falls short of "the invidious discrimination,"  Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S., at 489, or whether "any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify" the statutory discrimination,  McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420, 426 (1961); see  United States v. Maryland Savings-Share Ins. Corp., 400 U.S. 4, 6 (1970), or whether the classification is "on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of  statute," Reed v. Reed, ante, p. 71, at 76.  But the Court also has refined this traditional test and has said that a statutory classification based upon suspect criteria or affecting "fundamental rights" will encounter equal protection difficulties unless justified by a " compelling governmental interest."  Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 634, 638 (1969);  Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 247 n. 30 (1970) (opinion of BRENNAN, WHITE, and MARSHALL, JJ.).
Bail, of course, is basic to our system of law,  Stack v. Boyle , 342 U.S. 1 (1951); Herzog v. United States, 75 S. Ct. 349, 351, 99 L. Ed. 1299, 1301 (1955) (opinion of DOUGLAS, J.), and the Eighth Amendment's proscription of excessive bail has been assumed to have application to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Pilkinton v. Circuit Court, 324 F.2d 45, 46 (CA8 1963); see  Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 666 (1962), and id., at 675 (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).  But we are not at all concerned   here with any fundamental right to bail or with any Eighth Amendment-Fourteenth Amendment question of bail excessiveness.  Our concern, instead, is with the 1% cost-retention provision.  This smacks of administrative detail and of procedure and is hardly to be classified as a "fundamental" right or as based upon any suspect criterion.  The applicable measure, therefore, must be the traditional one: Is the distinction drawn by the statutes invidious and without rational basis?  Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 483-487 (1970). See Richardson v. Belcher, ante, p. 78, at 81.
IV
With this background, we turn to the appellants' primary argument.  It is threefold: (1) that the 1% retention charge under § 110-7 (f) is imposed on only one segment of the class gaining pretrial release; (2) that it is imposed on the poor and nonaffluent and not on the rich and affluent; 9 and (3) that its imposition with respect to an accused found innocent amounts to a court cost assessed against the not-guilty person.
We are compelled to note preliminarily that the attack on the Illinois bail statutes, in a very distinct sense, is paradoxical.  The benefits of the new system, as compared with the old, are conceded. 10 And the appellants recognize that under the pre-1964 system Schilb's particular bail bond cost would have been 10% of his bail, or $ 75; that this premium price for his pretrial freedom, once paid, was irretrievable; and that, if he could not have raised the $ 75, he would have been consigned to jail until his trial.  Thus, under the old system the cost of Schilb's pretrial freedom was $ 75, but under the new it was only $ 7.50.  While acknowledging this obvious benefit of the statutory reform, Schilb and his co-appellants decry the classification the statutes make and present the usual argument that the legislation must be struck down because it does not reform enough.
A. It is true that no charge is made to the accused who is released on his personal recognizance. We are advised, however, that this was also true under the old (pre-1964) system and that "Illinois has never charged people out on recognizance." 11 Thus, the burden on the State with respect to a personal recognizance is no more under the new system than what the State had assumed under the old.  Also, with a recognizance, there is nothing the State holds for safekeeping, with resulting responsibility and additional paperwork. All this provides a rational basis for distinguishing between the personal recognizance and the deposit situations.
There is also, however, no retention charge to the accused who deposits the full amount of cash bail or securities or real estate. Yet the administrative cost attendant upon the 10% deposit and that upon the full deposit are, by the stipulation, "substantially the same" with, indeed, any higher cost incurred with respect to the full deposit.
This perhaps is a more tenuous distinction, but we cannot conclude that it is constitutionally vulnerable.  One who deposits securities or encumbers his real estate precludes the use of that property for other purposes.  And one who deposits the full amount of his bail in cash is dispossessed of a productive asset throughout the period of the deposit; presumably, at least, its interim possession by the State accrues to the benefit of the State.  Further, the State's protection against the expenses that inevitably are incurred when bail is jumped is greater when 100% cash or securities or real estate is deposited or obligated than when only 10% of the bail amount is advanced.  The Joint Committee's and the State Legislature's decision in balancing these opposing considerations in the way that they did cannot be described as lacking in rationality to the point where equal protection considerations require that they be struck down.
Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305 (1966), lends no support to the appellants here. In that case a New Jersey statute imposed the cost of a transcript upon the indigent appellant who had been convicted  of a crime and was sentenced to prison and who then was unsuccessful on his appeal.  The statute, however, did not impose that cost upon the indigent appellant who likewise was convicted of a crime, and was unsuccessful on his appeal, but who had received a suspended sentence or who had been placed on probation or who had been fined rather than sentenced to prison.  The distinction the New Jersey statute drew between appellants was based only upon the nature of their punishment, and the burden was imposed only upon those who were confined.  The Court held, and rightly so, that a punishment distinction had no rational connection with a transcript cost and served to deny equal protection to the convicted appellant whose liberty was at issue on the appeal.  MR. JUSTICE STEWART, in speaking for the Court, said,
"The Equal Protection Clause requires more of a state law than nondiscriminatory application within the class it establishes.  It also imposes a requirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out.  To be sure, the constitutional demand is not a demand that a statute necessarily apply equally to all persons.  'The Constitution does not require things which  are different in fact . . . to be treated in law as though they were the same.' Hence, legislation may impose special burdens upon defined classes in order to achieve permissible ends.  But the Equal Protection Clause does require that, in defining a class subject to legislation, the distinctions that are drawn have   'some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.'" 384 U.S., at 308-309 (citations omitted).
The New Jersey distinction thus was invidious and without rationality for it was not related to the fiscal objectives of the statute and rested on no administrative convenience.
B. The poor-man-affluent-man argument centers, of course, in Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12 (1956), and in the many later cases that "reaffirm allegiance to the basic command that justice be applied equally to all persons."  Williams v. Illinois, 399 U.S. 235, 241 (1970).
In no way do we withdraw today from the Griffin principle. That remains steadfast.  But it is by no means certain, as the appellants suggest, that the 10% deposit provision under § 110-7 is a provision for the benefit of the poor and the less affluent and that the full-deposit provision of § 110-8 is one for the rich and the more affluent. It should be obvious that the poor man's real hope and avenue for relief is the personal recognizance provision of § 110-2.  We do not presume to say, as the appellants in their brief intimate, 12 that § 110-2 is not utilized by Illinois judges and made available for the poor and the less affluent.
Neither is it assured, as the appellants also suggest, that the affluent will take advantage of the full-deposit provision of § 110-8, with no retention charge, and that the less affluent are relegated to the 10% deposit provision of § 110-7 and the 1% retention charge.  The record is silent, but the flow indeed may be the other way.  The affluent, more  aware of and more experienced in the marketplace, may see the advantage, in these days of high interest rates, in retaining the use of 90% of the bail amount.  A 5% or greater return on this 90% in a short period of time more than offsets the 1% retention charge.  In other words, it is by no means clear that the route of § 110-8 is more attractive to the affluent defendant than the § 110-7 route.  The situation, therefore, wholly apart from the fact that appellant Schilb himself has not pleaded indigency, is not one where we may assume that the Illinois plan works to deny relief to the poor man merely because of his poverty.
C. The court-cost argument is that the person found innocent but already "put to the expense, disgrace and anguish of a trial" is "then assessed a cost for exercising his right to release pending trial." 13  Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399 (1966), is cited.  Giaccio was a holding that an ancient Pennsylvania statute that permitted the jury to impose court costs upon an acquitted defendant, in order to offset the expenses of prosecution, violated the Due Process Clause because of vagueness and the absence of any standards preventing the arbitrary imposition of costs.  The Court thus did not reach the merits, although MR. JUSTICE STEWART and Mr. Justice Fortas, each separately concurring, 382 U.S., at 405, felt that the very imposition of costs upon an acquitted defendant was violative of due process.
Giaccio is not dispositive precedent for the appellants here.  Certainly § 110-7 is not subject to attack for vagueness or for lack of standards.  Neither is it a vehicle for the imposition of costs of prosecution as was the Pennsylvania statute.  Instead, § 110-7 authorizes retention of the 1% as "bail bond costs." This is what that description implies, namely, an administrative cost imposed upon all those, guilty and innocent alike, who seek the benefit of § 110-7.  This conclusion is supported by the presence of the long-established Illinois rule against the imposition of costs of prosecution upon an acquitted or discharged criminal defendant,  Wells v. McCullock, 13 Ill. 606 (1852),  and by the Illinois court's own determination,  46 Ill. 2d, at 551-552, 264 N. E. 2d, at 384, that the charge under § 110-7 (f) is an administrative fee and not a cost of prosecution imposed under Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 38, § 180-3 (1969), only upon the convicted defendant.
V
Finally, the appellants would point out that Article 110 has its federal counterpart in § 3 (a) of the Bail Reform Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89-465, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 80 Stat. 214, and in particular in that portion now codified as 18 U. S. C. § 3146 (a)(3).  They note that S. 2840, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., contained a 1% retention provision "to defray bail bond costs" but that a parallel bill, S. 1357, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., as it progressed through Congress, at no time had a provision of that kind.  It was S. 1357 that was enacted as Pub. L. 89-465.
The committee reports, S. Rep. No. 750, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., and H. R. Rep. No. 1541, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., accompanying the 1966 Act, and the debates, 112 Cong. Rec. 12488-12504, 12841-12843, make no reference to this change from the earlier S. 2840.  In the face of this silence, and without more, and being cognizant of the fact that the federal act, unlike the Illinois one, was not directed against the professional bail bondsman, we are not inclined to read constitutional implications into the absence of the retention provision in the Bail Reform Act of 1966.
Neither are we inclined to read constitutional implications into either the   presence or the absence of a retention provision in corresponding statutes of States other than Illinois.  See N. Y. Laws 1936, c. 518, N. Y. Code Crim. Proc. § 586.3 (Supp. 1970-1971), having a 2% fee provision, now replaced by §§ 520.10-520.30 of New York's new Criminal Procedure Law, effective September 1, 1971, without the provision.  See Wis. Stat. §§ 969.02 (5) and 969.03 (1)(c) (1969), where a 1% fee is specified but not upon dismissal or acquittal.  See Alaska Stat. § 12.30.020 (b)(4) (Supp. 1971); D. C. Code Ann. § 23-1321 (a)(3) (Supp. 1971); and Iowa Code Ann. § 763.16.1c. (Supp. 1971), in each of which a 10% deposit is authorized with no fee-retention provision.
VI
We refrain from nullifying this Illinois statute that, with its companion sections, has brought reform and needed relief to the State's bail system.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is
Affirmed.

CONCUR BY: MARSHALL
MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, concurring.
I join the opinion of the Court with a few additional words.
All agree that the central purpose of the statute was to restrict severely the activities of professional bail bondsmen who had customarily collected 10% of the amount of each bond as a fee and retained all of it regardless of what happened.  All agree that the new scheme is, in general, an admirable attempt to reduce the cost of liberty for those awaiting trial.
The new scheme dealt only with the class of which appellant Schilb was a member -- those persons charged with crimes who under the old system were relegated to professional bondsmen who along with other requirements charged a 10% fee for the bond regardless of the outcome of the case.  This is the only class affected by the new scheme.  Members of this class now pay 1% instead of 10%. In the evolving struggle for meaningful bail reform I cannot find the present Illinois move toward that objective to be unconstitutional.
<dissent author="DOUGLAS" text="TRUE">
DISSENT BY: DOUGLAS; STEWART
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.
Appellant John Schilb brought this class action on behalf of all criminal defendants against whom the Clerk of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois, had assessed fees of 10% of the amounts deposited as bail bonds.  At issue was Ill. Ann. Stat., c. 38, § 100-7 (a) (1970), which allowed a defendant to be released from custody upon "deposit with the clerk of the court . . . a sum of money equal to 10% of the bail" which had been set by the court. Appellant challenged, under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision that "the clerk of the court . . . retain as bail bond costs 10% of the amount  deposited." Id., at § 110-7 (f).  He argued that this was an unconstitutional discrimination because bail bond costs were not imposed upon those who were released on their personal recognizance, id ., at § 110-2, or those who deposited cash or other security in the full amount of the bail bond. Id., at § 110-8.
The Circuit Court found the statute constitutional and dismissed the complaint. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the judgment,  46 Ill. 2d 538, 264 N. E. 2d 377; we noted probable jurisdiction,  402 U.S. 928.
The commercial bail bondsman has long been an anathema to the criminal defendant seeking to exercise his right to pretrial release.  In theory, courts were to set such amounts and conditions of bonds as were necessary to secure the appearance of defendants at trial. 1 Cf.   Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1   (1951). Those who did not have the resources to post their own bond were at the mercy of the bondsman who could exact exorbitant fees and unconscionable conditions for acting as surety. 2 See A. Beeley, The Bail System in Chicago 39 (1927); D. Freed & P. Wald, Bail in the United States: 1964, p. 34 (1964); R. Goldfarb, Ransom 92-126 (1965); Ares & Sturz, Bail and the Indigent Accused, 8 Crime & Delinquency 12 (1962); Boyle, Bail Under the Judicial Article,  17 De Paul L. Rev. 267, 272 (1968); Note,  106 U. Pa. L. Rev. 693 (1958); Note,  102 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1031 (1954). Criminal defendants often paid more in fees to bondsmen for securing their release than they were later to pay in penalties for their crimes.  Bowman, The Illinois Ten Per Cent Bail Deposit Provision,  1965 U. Ill. L. F. 35, 36.
Moreover, the commercial bond system failed to provide an incentive to the defendant to comply with the terms of his bond.  Whether or   not he appeared at trial, the defendant was unable to recover the fee he had paid to the bondsman. "No refund is or was made by the professional surety to a defendant for his routine compliance with the conditions of his bond." Kamin, Bail Administration in Illinois,  53 Ill. B. J. 674, 678 (1965).
It was in response to the abuses and inequities of the commercial bonding system that Illinois enacted the statutory scheme now under attack. 3 The Supreme Court of Illinois indicated "that the central purpose of the legislature . . . was to severely restrict the activities of professional bail bondsmen who customarily collected 10% of the amount of a bond as a fee which was retained  whether or not the conditions of the bond were met by the accused."  46 Ill. 2d, at 544, 264 N. E. 2d, at 380. To accomplish this end, it was only necessary to deal with the class represented by appellant.  Those defendants who posted security in the full amount of the bail bond or who were free on their own recognizance stood   in the same financial position under the new statutory scheme as under the old.  No costs have ever been imposed upon them and any security deposited has always been returned upon the satisfaction of the terms of the bond.
Those defendants who under the old system had utilized the services of the professional bondsman are now required to post with the clerk of the court 10%   of the face amount of their bonds in order to win their release.  The significant difference, however, is that upon satisfaction of the terms of their bonds, § 110-7 now allows them to recover 90% of the amount deposited, while no such recovery was ever had from the commercial bondsman. Rather than paying a fee of 10% of the face amount of the bond, therefore, the cost is now only 1%.
Appellant urges that the new system of pretrial release is constitutionally deficient despite the improvement it has wrought.  Appellant first argues that § 110-7 imposes costs upon only one class of criminal defendants without any rational basis for the classification. Next he asserts that the poor and nonaffluent, who have no choice but to remain in jail or deposit 10% of bail, are unconstitutionally penalized due to lack of wealth.  Finally, he says that § 110-7 violates the Due Process Clause insofar as it allows costs to be taxed against an accused who is ultimately found innocent.
In response, appellees assert that the classification implements the laudable purpose of eliminating the commercial bail bondsman. Under this view, the 1% fee is no more than the interest charged for allowing an accused his freedom upon payment of only 10% of the amount set as bail. Appellees urge that a system which requires liberal use of an accused's release on his own recognizance, Ill. Ann. Stat., c. 38, § 110-2 (1970), and which reduces to a fraction of the previous cost the financial burden on those required to post cash bonds, actually benefits the indigent. 4
I do not reach the question of equal protection but rest my decision on the issue stirred, but not decided, in  Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.S. 399.  The plaintiff in this action, John Schilb, was charged (1) with leaving the scene of an automobile accident and (2) obstructing traffic.  He posted a 10% bond on each charge -- one for $ 50 and one for $ 25; he was acquitted on the first one and was charged $ 7.50 on the two bonds.
The 1% charge is a part of the cost of a criminal prosecution, imposed even on an innocent person who is accused of a crime and who is put to the expense and anguish of a trial.  Giaccio involved a state statute which directed juries "in all cases of acquittals" to determine whether the government or the defendant should pay the costs.   382 U.S., at 400-401. We held the Act unconstitutional on grounds of vagueness.  MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring, said: "In the present case it is enough for me that Pennsylvania allows a jury to punish a defendant after finding him not guilty.  That, I think, violates the most rudimentary concept of due process of law."  382 U.S., at 405.
Mr. Justice Fortas also concurred, saying: "In my opinion, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit a State to impose a penalty or costs upon a defendant whom the jury has found not guilty of any offense with which he has been charged." Ibid.  That is my view on the merits in the instant case.
Some costs are the unavoidable consequences of a system of government which is required to proceed against its citizens in a public trial in an adversary proceeding.  Yet I see no basis for saying that an accused must bear the costs incurred by the Government in its unsuccessful prosecution of him. Imposition of costs upon individuals who have been acquitted has long been eschewed by our courts.   E. g., State v. Brooks, 33 Kan. 708, 715, 7 P. 591, 596 (1885);  Biester v. State, 65 Neb. 276, 91 N. W. 416 (1902);  Childers v. Commonwealth, 171 Va. 456, 198 S. E. 487 (1938). Some jurisdictions have provided that the imposition of costs upon acquitted individuals is reprehensible.  See, e. g., Costs in Criminal Cases Act, 15 &  16 Geo. 6 & 1 Eliz. 2, c. 48 (1952); Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Poverty and the Administration of Criminal Justice 31-32 (1963); Goldberg, Equality and Governmental Action,   39 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 205, 223-224 (1964); Note,  1962 Wash. U. L. Q. 76. Where there is such uniform condemnation of a practice as onerous as the imposition of costs upon acquitted defendants, cf. Leland v. Oregon, 343 U.S. 790, 798 (1952), I would conclude, with JUSTICES STEWART and Fortas in Giaccio, that it violates due process.
It is, however, said that the 1% charge is not "a vehicle for the imposition of costs of prosecution" and that it is merely "an administrative cost imposed upon all those, guilty and innocent alike, who seek the benefit of § 110-7." Ante, at 370, 370-371.  The costs of administering the bail system occur, by definition, only during the course of criminal prosecutions.  They are as much an element of the costs of conducting criminal cases as the prosecutor's salary, the fee for docketing an appeal, or the per diem paid to jurors.  Nor does the rubric "administrative" require a contrary result.  If this were the talisman through which a State could impose its costs upon acquitted defendants, I could see no stopping point and we might be left with a system in which an acquittal might be nearly as ruinous to the defendant as a conviction.
On the other aspects of the case facts are absent which we would need to know if we are to make an informed judgment on the requirements of equal protection. The discrimination condemned is an "invidious" one, it being recognized over and again that "legislation may impose special burdens upon defined classes in order to achieve permissible ends."  Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305, 309. The elimination of the professional bondsman seems to me to be a permissible end. The provision for the 10% bond is, in that view, an ameliorating one.  The problem on which this record leaves us in the dark is the actual working of that provision and the provision for release on personal recognizance. Not everyone, I assume, is entitled to pretrial release.  Equal protection would seem to require that each, whether rich or poor, black or white, is entitled to release on personal recognizance if he meets the requirements of stability, reputation, community ties, and so on.  In Illinois the record is silent 5 as to how the system of release on personal recognizance, as contrasted to release on the 10% bond, is in fact administered.  The manner of administration may, of course, raise serious equal protection questions.  For a statute fair on its face may be administered in an invidious way.  As stated in Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-374:
"Though the law itself be fair on its face and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution."
But, as I have said, the record contains no factual basis showing the manner of administration of the Illinois system.
I would reverse this judgment insofar as it imposed bail bond costs under the criminal charges of which members of the class represented by appellant were acquitted and remand for further proceedings respecting the bail bond costs on the charges on which they were convicted.

MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN concurs, dissenting.
In 1963, Illinois enacted new provisions governing bail in criminal cases.  Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 38, Art. 110 (1963).  These enactments provide that a person charged with a criminal offense may obtain pretrial release in one of four ways.
(1) The accused may be released on his own recognizance. Persons in this class do not pay any costs to cover the administration of their release.  § 110-2.
(2) The accused may deposit 10% of the full amount of the bail that has been set.  § 110-7.  When bail is made in this manner, the clerk of the court ultimately retains as bail costs 1% of the full amount of bail (10% of the amount actually deposited).  § 110-7 (f).
(3) The accused may offer cash, stocks or bonds in an amount equivalent to the required bail. No administrative costs are imposed.  § 110-8 (a)(1).
(4) The accused may secure double the amount of required bail in unencumbered real estate. Again, no administrative costs are imposed.  § 110-8 (a)(2) and (f).
A person must satisfy a judge that he meets certain criteria to be eligible for release on his own recognizance. Otherwise the State allows individuals to choose freely among the three other methods of obtaining pretrial release (assuming the individual has the wherewithal to make a choice).
The 1963 bail provisions of the Illinois Criminal Code represented substantial reforms in the State's procedures for granting pretrial release.  The central purpose of the legislation was to restrict severely the activities of professional bail bondsmen who had customarily collected 10% of the amount of a bond as a fee, which they retained whether or not the conditions of bond were met by the accused. 1 Before 1963, accused persons who could not obtain release on their own recognizance had no choice but to offer the full amount of the bail that was set.  The primary innovation of bail reform was to create a class of "ten-percenters,"  persons who could gain release by depositing only 10% of the required bail.
Appellant John Schilb was charged with leaving the scene of an accident and obstructing traffic.  Bail was set at $ 500 for the first offense and $ 250 for the second.  As a "ten-percenter," the appellant posted $ 50 and $ 25 bonds.  He was found guilty of the second charge and not guilty of the first.  After these judgments were entered, the State retained $ 5 and $ 2.50 respectively, as administrative costs on his bonds.  Subsequently, the appellant brought this class action against the clerk of the Circuit Court of St. Clair County, Illinois, alleging that the cost-retention provision of the state bail law, § 110-7 (f), constitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because administrative costs are imposed only on that class of persons who obtain pretrial release by depositing 10% of the required bail. The Illinois Supreme Court ultimately upheld the validity of § 110-7 (f), with two justices dissenting.   46 Ill. 2d 538, 264 N. E. 2d 377 (1970).
It is common ground that the Illinois bail reform scheme reflects an admirable attempt to reduce the cost of liberty for those awaiting trial.  Chapter 38, § 110-7 (f), does arbitrarily discriminate, however, against the appellant and those similarly situated. 2 As this Court said in  Rinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305:
"The Equal Protection Clause requires more of a state law than nondiscriminatory application within the class it establishes.  It also imposes a requirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out. . . .  Legislation may impose special burdens upon defined classes in order to achieve permissible ends.  But the Equal Protection Clause does require that, in defining a class subject to legislation, the distinctions that are drawn have 'some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.'"  Id., at 308-309 (citations omitted).
The Court assumes that the rationality of § 110-7 (f)'s classification should be analyzed in relation to the purpose of ending the evils created by the bail bond system.  However, while ending those evils is the aim of the whole bail reform, it is not the aim of § 110-7 (f) itself.  Rather, the appellees have acknowledged that the purpose of § 110-7 (f) is to cover administrative costs; they have also acknowledged in oral argument that the financial burden on the State is probably as great or greater for those who use the other methods of obtaining pretrial release. 3 Can the appellees constitutionally   justify the selective imposition of administrative costs? 4 I think not.
The Illinois Supreme Court held that there can be no unconstitutional discrimination in the state system of bail release, since each person accused has a choice of method for obtaining pretrial release.   46 Ill. 2d, at   548, 264 N. E. 2d, at 382. Those who deposit 10%, said the court, "are not automatically placed in this class . . . by the law.  They join only by the exercise of their own volition." Whether many persons accused of crimes can really choose between paying 10% or paying the full amount (or securing double the amount in real estate) is highly debatable. 5 But however that may be, it is clear that not every person accused of a crime is free to choose to be released on his own recognizance. Yet those who are fortunate enough to be so released need pay no costs whatever.
The appellees argue that those who pay only 10% are being given a benefit that justifies imposing a burden.  The appellees say that such persons are not required to put up the full amount of the bail set and that the 1% such persons do ultimately pay is a boon by comparison to the 10% of required bail that they would have automatically forfeited to the bondsman under the old procedures governing bail. This justification, however, also fails to distinguish between the "ten-percenters" and those who are released on their own recognizance. Obviously, those released on their own recognizance receive an even greater benefit than those who deposit 10%, since they give no money to the State at any time if they meet the conditions of release. 6
The appellees attempt to distinguish between those released on their own recognizance and the "ten-percenters" by noting that the recognizance practice is "historic," whereas the cost-retention provision was recently enacted to end the evils spawned by bail bondsmen. 7 This distinction, however, does not confront the reality that both classes of persons receive benefits and only one class must pay administrative costs.  A second attempt to distinguish between those released on their own recognizance and those who deposit 10% turns on the idea that the members of the former class are more "worthy" of the benefit they receive and therefore may rationally be required to pay less.  But while the criteria used by judges to determine release on one's own recognizance -- e. g., length of residence in the jurisdiction, marital status, employment record, or past criminal record -- are obviously relevant to the recognizance decision, they are not rationally related to the decision to impose purely administrative costs, especially when such costs are at least as great for those released on their own recognizance as for those required to post bond.
Given the infirmities in the asserted justifications for § 110-7 (f), I think the imposition of administrative costs on only one class of those persons seeking pretrial release violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment before us.
