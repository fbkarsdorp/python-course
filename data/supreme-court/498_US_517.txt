OPINION
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of
the Court.
This case requires us to decide whether postal employees are
within the "zone of interests" of the group of statutes known as the Private
Express Statutes (PES), so that they may challenge the action of the United
States Postal Service in suspending the operation of the PES with respect to a
practice of private courier services called "international remailing." We hold
that they are not.
Since its establishment, the United States Postal Service has
exercised a monopoly over the carriage of letters in and from the United States.
The postal monopoly is codified in the PES, 18 U. S. C. §§ 1693-1699 and 39 U.
S. C. §§ 601-606. The monopoly was created by Congress as a revenue protection
measure for the Postal Service to enable it to fulfill its mission. See Regents
of Univ. of Cal. v. Public Employment Relations Bd., 485 U.S. 589, 598, 99 L.
Ed. 2d 664, 108 S. Ct. 1404 (1988). It prevents private competitors from
offering service on low-cost routes at prices below those of the Postal Service,
while leaving the Service with high-cost routes and insufficient means to
fulfill its mandate of providing uniform rates and service to patrons in all
areas, including those that are remote or less populated. See J. Haldi, Postal
Monopoly: An Assessment of the Private Express Statutes 9 (1974); Craig & Alvis,
The Postal Monopoly: Two Hundred Years of Covering Commercial as Well as
Personal Messages, 12 U. S. F. L. Rev. 57, 60, and n.8 (1977).
A provision of the PES allows the Postal Service to "suspend [the PES
restrictions] upon any mail route where the public interest requires the
suspension." 39 U. S. C. § 601(b). In 1979, the Postal Service suspended the PES
restrictions for "extremely urgent letters," thereby allowing overnight delivery
of letters by private courier services. 39 CFR § 320.6 (1990); 44 Fed. Reg.
61178 (1979). Private courier services, including members of
petitioner-intervenor Air Courier Conference of America, relied on that
suspension to engage in a practice called "international remailing."
This entails bypassing the Postal Service and using private courier
systems to deposit with foreign postal systems letters destined for foreign
addresses. Believing this international remailing was a misuse of the
urgent-letter suspension, the Postal Service issued a proposed modification and
clarification of its regulation in order to make clear that the suspension for
extremely urgent letters did not cover this practice.  50 Fed. Reg. 41462 (1985)
. The comments received in response to the proposed rule were overwhelmingly
negative and focused on the perceived benefits of international  
remailing: Lower cost, faster delivery, greater reliability, and enhanced
ability of United States companies to remain competitive in the international
market. Because of the vigorous opposition to the proposed rule, the Postal
Service agreed to reconsider its position and instituted a rulemaking "to remove
the cloud" over the validity of the international remailing services.  51 Fed.
Reg. 9852, 9853 (1986). After receiving additional comments and holding a public
meeting on the subject, on June 17, 1986, the Postal Service issued a proposal
to suspend operation of the PES for international remailing. Id., at
21929-21932. Additional comments were received, and after consideration of the
record it had compiled, the Postal Service issued a final rule suspending the
operation of the PES with respect to international remailing. Id., at 29637.
Respondents, the American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, and the National
Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO (Unions), sued in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the international
remailing regulation pursuant to the judicial review provisions of the
Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. § 702. They claimed that the
rulemaking record was inadequate to support a finding that the suspension of the
PES for international remailing was in the public interest. Petitioner Air
Courier Conference of America (ACCA) intervened. On December 20, 1988,
the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Postal Service and
ACCA.  American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. United States Postal Service,
701 F. Supp. 880 (1988). The Unions appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, and that court vacated the grant of summary
judgment.  American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO v. United States Postal
Service, 282 U.S. App. D.C. 5, 891 F.2d 304 (1989). It held that the Unions
satisfied the zone-of-interests requirement for APA review under Clarke v.
Securities Industry Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 93 L. Ed. 2d 757, 107 S. Ct. 750 (1987)
, and that the Postal Service's regulation was arbitrary and capricious because
it relied on too narrow an interpretation of "the public interest." In
determining that the Unions' interest in employment opportunities was protected
by the PES, the Court of Appeals noted that the PES were reenacted as part of
the Postal Reorganization Act (PRA), Pub. L. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719, codified at
39 U. S. C. § 101 et seq. The Court of Appeals found that a "key impetus" and
"principal purpose" of the PRA was "to implement various labor reforms that
would improve pay, working conditions and labor-management relations for postal
employees." 282 U.S. App. D.C. 5 at 10, 891 F.2d 304 at 309-310. Reasoning that
"the Unions' asserted interest is embraced directly by the labor reform
provisions of the PRA," id., at 11, 891 F.2d at 310, and that "the PES
constitute the linchpin in a statutory scheme concerned with maintaining an
effective, financially viable Postal Service," ibid., the court concluded that
"the interplay between the PES and the entire PRA persuades us that there is an
'arguable' or 'plausible' relationship between the purposes of the PES and the
interests of the Union." Ibid. The Court of Appeals also held that "the
revenue protective purposes of the PES, standing alone, plausibly
relate to the Unions' interest in preventing the reduction of employment
opportunities, " since "postal workers benefit from the PES's function
in ensuring a sufficient revenue base" for the Postal Service's activities.
Ibid.
Addressing the merits of the Unions' challenge to the suspension order,
the Court of Appeals held that it was arbitrary and capricious because the
Postal Service had applied § 601(b)'s public interest test too narrowly by
considering only the benefits of the international remail rule to the small
segment of the Postal Service's consumer base that engages in international
commerce. We granted certiorari, 496 U.S. 904 (1990), and we now reverse.
The United States Postal Service, nominally a respondent,
argues along with ACCA that the Unions do not have standing to challenge the
Postal Service's suspension of the PES for international remailing. The Postal
Service argues now that Congress precluded judicial review of Postal Service
action under the APA by enacting 39 U. S. C. § 410(a), which the Postal Service
contends provides that Chapters 5 and 7 of Title 5 do not apply to the Postal
Service. 1 Chapters 5 and 7 of Title 5 are the provisions of the APA dealing
with "Administrative Procedure" (Chapter 5) and "Judicial Review" (Chapter 7).
The Postal Service
raised this argument for the first time in its brief in opposition to the
petition for writ of certiorari. It was not argued to either of the lower
courts, and was not considered by either court below in deciding this case. This
issue was not raised by ACCA in its petition for writ of certiorari, nor is it
encompassed by the questions presented upon which we based our grant of
certiorari. 2 Consequently,  we decline to decide whether § 410(a)
exempts the Postal Service from judicial review under the APA. 3
To establish standing to sue under the APA,
respondents must establish that they have suffered a legal wrong because of the
challenged agency action, or are adversely affected or "aggrieved by agency
action within the meaning of a relevant statute." 5 U. S. C. § 702. Once they
have shown that they are adversely affected, i. e., have suffered an "injury in
fact," see Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 751, 82 L. Ed. 2d 556, 104 S. Ct. 3315
(1984), the Unions must show that they are within the zone of interests sought
to be protected through the PES.  Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497
U.S. 871, 111 L. Ed. 2d 695, 110 S. Ct. 3177 (1990);Clarke v.
Securities Industry Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 93 L. Ed. 2d 757, 107 S. Ct. 750 (1987)
;Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S.
150, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184, 90 S. Ct. 827 (1970). Specifically, "the plaintiff must
establish that the injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse
effect upon him) falls within the 'zone of interests' sought to be protected by
the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his
complaint." Lujan, supra, at 883 (citing Clarke, supra, at 396-397).
The District Court found that the Unions had satisfied the
injury-in-fact test because increased competition through international
remailing services might have an adverse effect on employment opportunities of
postal workers. This finding of injury in fact was not appealed. The question
before us, then, is whether the adverse effect on the employment opportunities
of postal workers resulting from the suspension is within the zone of interests
encompassed by the PES -- the statutes which the Unions assert the Postal
Service has violated in promulgating the international remailing rule.
The Court of Appeals found that the Unions had standing because "the revenue
protective purposes of the PES, standing alone, plausibly relate to the Unions'
interest in preventing the reduction of employment opportunities." 282 U.S. App.
D.C. at 11, 891 F.2d at 310. This view is mistaken, for it conflates the
zone-of-interests test with injury in fact. In Lujan, this Court gave the
following example illustrating how injury in fact does not necessarily mean one
is within the zone of interests to be protected by a given statute:
"The failure of an agency to comply with a statutory provision
requiring 'on the record' hearings would assuredly have an adverse
effect upon the company that has the contract to record and transcribe
the agency's proceedings; but since the provision was obviously
enacted to protect the interests of the parties to the proceedings and
not those of the reporters, that company would not be 'adversely
affected within the meaning' of the statute." 497 U.S. at 883.
We must inquire, then, as to Congress' intent in enacting the PES in order to
determine whether postal workers were meant to be within the zone of interests
protected by those statutes. The particular language of the statutes provides no
support for respondents' assertion that Congress intended to protect
jobs with the Postal Service. 4 In fact, the provisions of 18 U. S.
C. § 1696(c), allowing private conveyance of letters if done on a
one-time basis or without compensation, and 39 U. S. C. § 601(a), allowing
letters to be carried out of the mails if certain procedures are followed,
indicate that the congressional concern was not with opportunities for postal
workers but with the receipt of necessary revenues for the Postal
Service.
Nor does the history of this legislation -- such as it is -- indicate that the
PES were intended for the benefit of postal workers. When the first statutes
limiting private carriage of letters on post roads were enacted in 1792, the
Post Office offered no pickup or delivery services. See C. Scheele, A Short
History of the Mail Service 66, 91 (1970). Statutory authority to employ letter
carriers was not enacted until two years later and was largely ignored until the
late 1820's. Id., at 66. The 1792 restrictions on private carriage protected the
Government's capital investment in the post roads, not the jobs of as yet
virtually nonexistent postal employees. In 1825 and 1827, Acts were passed
prohibiting the private carriage of letters through the use of stages or other
vehicles, packet boats, or other vessels, § 19, ch. 64 of Act of March 3, 1825,
4 Stat. 107, and foot and horse posts, § 3, ch. 61 of Act of March 2, 1827, 4
Stat. 238. Postal employees cannot have been within the zone of interests of
either the 1824 or 1827 Acts; those Acts targeted transportation of mail which
even then was contracted out to private carriers. See W. Fuller, The American
Mail: Enlarger of the Common Life 150 (1972).
Congress' consideration of the 1845 Act was the only occasion on which the
postal monopoly was the subject of substantial debate. The 1845
statute, entitled "An Act to reduce the rates of postage, to limit the use and
correct the abuse of the franking privilege, and for the prevention of frauds on
the revenues of the Post Office Department," 5 Stat. 732, was the result of
three circumstances, none of which involved the interests of postal employees.
First, the Post Office Department continued to run substantial deficits in spite
of high postage rates. H. R. Rep. No. 477, 28th Cong., 1st Sess., 2-3, 5 (1844).
Second, high postal rates enabled private expresses to make substantial inroads
into the domestic market for delivery of letters and the 1825 and 1827 Acts
proved unsuccessful in prosecuting them. Priest, The History of the  
Postal Monopoly in the United States, 18 J. Law & Econ. 33, 60 (1975) (citing
United States v. Gray, 26 F. Cas. 18 (No. 15,253) (Mass. 1840), and United
States v. Adams, 24 F. Cas. 761 (No. 14,421) (SDNY 1843)). Third, inauguration
of the "penny post" in England quadrupled use of the mails, and it was thought
that a substantial reduction in American postal rates would have the dual
virtues of driving private expresses out of business and increasing mail volume
of the Post Office. This, in turn, would help reduce the Post Office's deficit.
Cong. Globe, 28th Cong., 2d Sess., 213 (1845) (remarks of Sens. Simmons and
Breese). See also H. R. Rep. No. 477, supra, at 5.
The legislative history of the sections of
the Act limiting private carriage of letters shows a two-fold purpose. First,
the Postmaster General and the States most distant from the commercial centers
of the Northeast believed that the postal monopoly was necessary to prevent
users of faster private expresses from taking advantage of early market
intelligence and news of international affairs that had not yet reached the
general populace through the slower mails. S. Doc. No. 66, 28th Cong., 2d Sess.,
3-4 (1845). Second, it was thought to be the duty of the Government to serve
outlying, frontier areas, even if it meant doing so below cost. H. R. Rep. No.
477,  supra, at 2-3. Thus, the revenue protection provisions were not seen
as an end in themselves, nor in any sense as a means of ensuring
certain levels of public employment, but rather were seen as the means to
achieve national integration and to ensure that all areas of the Nation were
equally served by the Postal Service.
The PES enable the Postal Service to fulfill its responsibility to provide
service to all communities at a uniform rate by preventing private courier
services from competing selectively with the Postal Service on its most
profitable routes. If competitors could serve the lower cost segment of the
market, leaving the Postal Service to handle the high-cost services, the Service
would lose lucrative portions of its business, thereby increasing its
average unit cost and requiring higher prices to all users. 5 See Report of the
President's Commission on Postal Organization, Towards Postal
Excellence, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 129 (Comm. Print 1968).   The postal
monopoly, therefore, exists to ensure that postal services will be provided to
the citizenry at large, and not to secure employment for postal workers.
The Unions' claim on the merits is that the Postal Service
has failed to comply with the mandate of 39 U. S. C. § 601(b) that the PES be
suspended only if the public interest requires. The foregoing discussion has
demonstrated that the PES were not designed to protect postal employment or
further postal job opportunities, but the Unions argue that the courts should
look beyond the PES to the entire 1970 PRA in applying the zone-of-interests
test. The Unions argue that because one of the purposes of the labor-management
provisions of the PRA was to stabilize labor-management relations within the
Postal Service, and because the PES is the "linchpin" of the Postal Service,
employment opportunities of postal workers are arguably within the zone of
interests covered by the PES. The Unions rely upon our opinion in Clarke v.
Securities Industry Assn., 479 U.S. 388, 93 L. Ed. 2d 757, 107 S. Ct. 750 (1987)
, to support this contention.
Clarke is the most recent in a series of cases in which we have held
that competitors of regulated entities have standing to challenge regulations.
Clarke, supra; Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U.S. 617, 28 L. Ed. 2d 367,
91 S. Ct. 1091 (1971); Association of Data Processing Service Organizations,
Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 25 L. Ed. 2d 184, 90 S. Ct. 827 (1970). In Clarke,
we said that "we are not limited to considering the statute under which
respondents sued, but may consider any provision that helps us to understand
Congress' overall purposes in the National Bank Act." 479 U.S. at 401. This
statement, like all others in our opinions, must be taken in the context in
which it was made. In the next paragraph of the opinion, the Court pointed out
that 12 U. S. C. § 36, which the plaintiffs in that case claimed had been
misinterpreted by the Comptroller, was itself "a limited exception to the
otherwise applicable requirement of  § 81," limiting the places at
which a national bank could transact business to its headquarters and any
"branches" permitted by § 36. Thus the zone-of-interests test was to be applied
not merely in the light of § 36, which was the basis of the plaintiffs' claim on
the merits, but also in the light of § 81, to which § 36 was an exception.
The situation in the present case is quite different. The only
relationship between the PES, upon which the Unions rely for their claim on the
merits, and the labor-management provisions of the PRA, upon which the Unions
rely for their standing, is that both were included in the general codification
of postal statutes embraced in the PRA. The statutory provisions enacted and
reenacted in the PRA are spread over some 65 pages in the United
States Code and take up an entire title of that volume. We said in Lujan that
"the relevant statute  of course, is the statute whose violation
is the gravamen of the complaint." 497 U.S. at 886. To adopt the unions'
contention would require us to hold that the "relevant statute" in this case is
the PRA, with all of its various provisions united only by the fact that they
deal with the Postal Service. But to accept this level of generality in
defining the "relevant statute" could deprive the zone-of-interests test of
virtually all meaning.
Unlike the two sections of the National Bank Act discussed in Clarke, supra,
none of the provisions of the PES have any integral relationship with the
labor-management provisions of the PRA. When it enacted the PRA, Congress made
no substantive changes to those portions of the PES codified in the Criminal
Code, 18 U. S. C. §§ 1693-1699; Congress readopted without change those portions
of the PES codified in the Postal Service Code, 39 U. S. C. §§ 601-606; and
Congress required the Postal Service to conduct a 2-year study and reevaluation
of the PES before deciding whether those laws should be modified or repealed.
PRA, Pub. L. 91-375, § 7, 84 Stat. 783; S. Rep. No. 91-912, p. 22 (1970); H. R.
Rep. No. 91-1104, p. 48 (1970).
None of the documents constituting the PRA legislative history suggest that
those concerned with postal reforms saw any connection between the PES and the
provisions of the PRA dealing with labor-management relations. The Senate and
House Reports simply note that the proposed bills continue existing law without
change and require the Postal Service to conduct a study of the PES. The Court
of Appeals referred to the PES as the "linchpin" of the Postal Service, which it
may well be; but it stretches the zone-of-interests test too far to say that
because of that fact those who a different part of the PRA was designed to
benefit may challenge a violation of the PES.
It would be a substantial extension of our
holdings in Clarke, supra,Data Processing, supra, and Investment Co. Institute,
supra, to allow the Unions in this case to leapfrog from their asserted
protection under the labor-management provisions of the PRA to their claim on
the merits under the PES. We decline to make that extension, and hold that
the Unions do not have standing to challenge the Postal Service's
suspension of the PES to permit private couriers to engage in international
remailing. We therefore do not reach the merits of the Unions' claim
that the suspension was not in the public interest. The judgment of the Court of
Appeals is
Reversed.
CONCUR BY: STEVENS

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL and JUSTICE BLACKMUN join,
concurring in the judgment.
There is no ambiguity in the text of 39 U. S. C. § 410 (a). That section of the
Postal Reorganization Act provides that the judicial review
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) do not apply to the
exercise of the powers of the Postal Service. See ante, at 522, n.1. It is
therefore not only unnecessary, but also unwise, for the Court to issue an
opinion on the entirely hypothetical question whether, if the APA did authorize
judicial review of actions of the Postal Service, its employees would have
standing to invoke such review to challenge a regulation that may curtail their
job opportunities. I therefore do not join the opinion discussing this
hypothetical standing question.
Nor do I consider it necessary to decide whether this objection to
judicial review may be waived by the Postal Service, because it is surely a
matter that we may notice on our own motion. * Faithful adherence to the
doctrine of judicial restraint provides a fully adequate justification for
deciding this case on the best and narrowest ground available. I would do
so. Accordingly, relying solely on 39 U. S. C. § 410(a), I concur in the
Court's judgment that the Unions' challenge must be dismissed.
