OPINION
The motion for leave to proceed  in forma pauperis and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
Petitioner appealed his conviction for murder to the Georgia Supreme Court where he sought reversal on the ground, among others, that the evidence relevant to his claim of systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand and petit juries drawn in the county established a prima facie case of the denial of equal protection within our decision in  Whitus v. Georgia, 385 U.S. 545. * The Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the conviction stating that Whitus was distinguishable because "public officers are presumed to have discharged their sworn official duties. . . .  Under the testimony in this case we can not assume that the jury commissioners did not eliminate prospective jurors on the basis of their competency to serve, rather than because of racial discrimination."  223 Ga. 157, 162, 154 S. E. 2d 228, 232.
We hold that   the burden upon the State to explain "the disparity between the percentage of Negroes on the tax digest and those on the venires,"  Whitus, supra, at 552, was not met by the Georgia Supreme Court's reliance on the stated presumptions.  See  Arnold v. North Carolina, 376 U.S. 773;  Eubanks v. Louisiana, 356 U.S. 584;  Williams v. Georgia, 349 U.S. 375; Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.S. 559;  Cassell v. Texas, 339 U.S. 282;  Norris v. Alabama, 294 U.S. 587. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.
It is so ordered.
