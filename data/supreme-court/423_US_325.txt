PER CURIAM.
The Court is advised that the petitioner died at New Bern, N. C., on November 14, 1975.  The petition for certiorari is therefore dismissed.  To the extent that Durham  v. United States,  401 U.S. 481 (1971), may be inconsistent with this ruling, Durham  is overruled.
It is so ordered.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE dissents.
