      "So far, we have primarily dealt with unstructured data in this course: we have learned to read, for example, the contents of plain text files in the previous chapters. Such raw textual data is often called 'unstructured', because it lacks annotations that make explicit the function or meaning of the words in the documents. If we read the contents of a play as a plain text, for instance, we don't have a clue to which scene or act a particular utterance belongs, or by which character the utterance was made. Nowadays, it is therefore increasingly common to add annotations to a text that give us a better insight into the\n",
      "semantics and structure of the data. Adding annotations to texts (e.g. scholarly editions of Shakepeare), is typically done using some form of markup. Various markup-languages exist that allow us to provide structured and unambiguous annotations to a (digital) text. XML or the \"eXtensible Mark-up Language\" is currently one of the dominant standards to encode texts in the Digital Humanities. In this chapter, we'll assume that have at least some notion of XML, although we will have a quick refresher below. XML is a pretty straightforward mark-up language: let's have a look at Shakepeare's well-known sonnet 18 encoded in XML (you can find this poem also as `sonnet.txt` in your `data/TEI` folder)."

Each start tag must correspond to exactly one end tag, although XML does allow for \"solo\" elements such the `<volta/>` tag after line 8 in this example.

      "This limitation has to with the fact that XML is a *hierarchical* markup language: it assumes that we can describe a text document as a tree of branching nodes. In this tree, elements cannot have more than one direct parent element (otherwise the hearchy would be ambiguous). The one exception is the so-called root element, which as the highest node in tree does not have a parent element itself. Logically speaking, all this entails that a valid XML document can only have a single *root element*. Note that all non-root elements can have as many siblings as we wish. All the `<line>` elements in our sonnet, for example, are siblings, in the sense that they have in common a direct parent element, i.e. the <sonnet> tag. Finally, note that we can add extra information to our elements using so-called attributes. The `n` attribute, for example, give us the line number for each line in the sonnet, surrounded by double quotation marks. The <sonnet> element illlustrates that we can add as many attributes as we want to a tag. "

      "As you can see, all the tag and attribute names are different in this version, but the essential structure is still the same. You could therefore say that XML is a markup language which provides a *syntax* to talk about texts, but does not come with a default *semantics*. This freedom in choosing name tags etc. can also be a bit daunting: this is why the TEI provides Guidelines as how tag names etc. can be used to mark up specific phenomena in texts. The TEI therefore also refers to a rather bulky set of guidelines as to which tags could be used to properly encode a text. Below, we read in a fairly advanced example of Shakepeare's 17th sonnet encoded in TEI (note the use of the `<TEI>` tag as our root node!). Even the metrical structure has been encoded as you will see, so this can be considered an example \"TEI on steroids\". "

      "OK, it time to get your hands even more dirty. For textual analyses, there are a number of great datasets out there which have been encoded in rich XML. One excellent resource which we have recently worked with, can be found at [theatre-classique.fr](http://www.theatre-classique.fr/): this website holds an extensive collection of French plays from the time of the Classical and Enlightenment era in France. Some of the plays have been authored by some of France's finest authors such as Moli\u00e8re pr Pierre and Thomas Corneille. What is interesting about this resource, is that it provides a very rich XML markup: apart from extensive metadata on the play or a detailed descriptions of the actors involved, the actually lines have been encoded in such a manner, that we perfectly know which character uttered a particular line, or to which scene or act a line belongs. This allows us to perform much richer textual analyses than if we would only have a raw text version of the plays. We have collected a subset of these plays for you under the `data/TEI`directory:"
