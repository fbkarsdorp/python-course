      "Imagine you have collected a large number of documents for your research. A large collection of English novels from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), for example, or all volumes of the *New York Times* from 1987 until 2007 (see [here](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19)). The *New York Times* corpus contains over 1.8 million articles. If on average each article consists of only 500 words (the actual number will probably be higher), the complete corpus will contain about 900 million words. How can we search through such large collections of text? How can we efficiently find the information we are looking for? \n",

      "These questions are central to the current chapter. We will discuss important concepts from *Information Retrieval* to index and search collections (of text), such as the *inverted index* and the ranking metric *Okapi BM25*. This wouldn't be a Python course if you didn't have to implement all discussed techniques and methods. We will implement an important search algorithm which allows you to efficiently and reliably extract information from corpora. Along the way we will discuss quite some new and important programming techniques and constructs. We will also further our knowledge about the framework of Object Oriented Programming or OOP. We have quite some ground to cover, so let's get started."

To account for this intuition we need a way to score and sort our search results.\n",

      "I have taken the liberty to make some minor adjustments to the class and add some methods to present the results of a query. The method `score` implements Okapi BM25 quite straightforwardly. Note that I added a boolean attribute called `_all_set` to the class. This attribute tells the system whether all the pieces of information to compute the Okapi BM25 scores have been collected. In the method `query` we ask whether all is set. If not, we first compute the document frequencies of each unique term in our collection as well as the average document length. The reason I do not compute this earlier is that after a document has been added to the index, we need to recompute all these values (note that we set `_all_set` in `index_document` to `False`). Since we do not know whether a user of this class will add some more documents after having indexed a complete collection earlier, it is safer to postpone these computations. The methods `present` and `present_results` are two helper methods to more conveniently print the results of a query.\n",
