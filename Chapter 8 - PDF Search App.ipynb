      "The Information Retrieval system we created in the previous chapter is simple and relatively efficient, but it lacks many features of a full-blown search engine. One particular downside of the system is that it stores the index in RAM memory. This means that either we have to keep the index in memory or we have to rebuild the index each time we would like to search through a particular collection. There are some excellent Python packages for Information Retrieval and search engines. In this section we will explore one of them, called [Whoosh](http://whoosh.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), a search engine and retrieval system written in pure Python. \n",

      "Ever since science-journal giant Elsevier bought the once so promising bibliography management software [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/), I have looked for alternative ways to manage my research PDF collection. For me, one of the most important features of a PDF management tool is to be able to do full text search in the PDFs for the content I am interested in. Uptill today I have not found a tool that fulfills all my needs, so we are going to build one ourselves. We will construct a full-blown search engine using Whoosh which we can query using a web interface build with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Just to tease you a bit: this is what our search engine will look like:\n",

      "This chapter is the first in a series of more practical chapters, in which we will build actual applications ready for use by end-users. You won't be learning many new programming techniques in this chapter, but we will introduce you to a large number of modules and packages that are available either in the standard library of Python or as third-party packages. The most important take-home message is that if you think about implementing a piece of software, the first thing you should do, is check whether somebody else hasn't done it before you. Chances are good that someone has, and she or he probably has done a better job. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before we get started, make sure you have installed both Whoosh and Flask on your computer. If you use Anaconda's Python distribution, you can execute the following command on the commandline:\n",
      "\n",
      "    conda install whoosh flask\n",
